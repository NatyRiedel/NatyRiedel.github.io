INTRODUCTION: N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prominent mRNA modification, plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes. However,  the roles of m6A RNA modification in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the mRNA expression and clinical significance of m6A-related genes using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)  liver hepatocellular carcinoma cohort. Mutation, copy number variation (CNV), methylation, differential expression, and gene ontology analyses, gene set enrichment analysis and the construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the aberrant expression of m6A-related genes. RESULTS: m6A-related genes were frequently dysregulated in cancers but with a cancer-specific pattern. METTL3, YTHDF2, and ZC3H13 were found to be independent  prognostic factors of overall survival (OS); however, only METTL3 was found to be an independent prognostic factor of recurrence-free survival (RFS). Joint effects analysis showed the predictive capacity of combining METTL3, YTHDF2, and ZC3H13 for HCC OS. Then the potential mechanisms of METTL3 were further explored due to  its prognostic role in both OS and RFS. CNV and DNA methylation, but not somatic  mutations, might contribute to the abnormal upregulation of METTL3 in HCC. Significantly altered genes, microRNAs, and lncRNAs were identified, and a ceRNA  regulatory network was constructed to explain the upregulation of METTL3 in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified several m6A-related genes, especially METTL3, that could be potential prognostic biomarkers in HCC.  DOI: 10.1007/s10620-020-06260-z 	32333311

Although deregulated circulatory miRNA signatures during diabetes have been identified for some years now, the effects of such miRNAs on several target tissues are not yet thoroughly investigated. The skin that is nourished by components present in the circulation exhibits several notable abnormal features  during diabetes. We, therefore, hypothesized that such altered circulatory miRNA  levels might be critical in the onset and progression of impaired skin health during diabetes. RNA sequencing from blood samples of normal and type 2 diabetic  human subjects identified 9 upregulated and 19 downregulated miRNAs. miR-98-5p was significantly downregulated and its overexpression down-regulated PPP1R15B levels in HaCaT cells and this was prevented by the miR-98-5p inhibitor. This was validated in human primary epidermal keratinocytes and further supported by a dual reporter luciferase assay of the PPP1R15B 3'UTR where miR-98-5p significantly decreased the luciferase activity which was prevented in the presence of the miRNA inhibitor and by mutation in the miRNA binding site. By targeting PPP1R15B, miR-98-5p increases levels of p-eIF2α, BiP and CHOP. Consequently, there was induction of apoptosis accompanied with decreased proliferation in the presence of miR-98-5p. Conversely, miR-98-5p inhibition alone inhibited apoptosis and promoted proliferation. Taken together, our data suggest that by targeting PPP1R15B, miR-98-5p induces apoptosis and decreases proliferation. As opposed to this since circulatory miR-98-5p levels are decreased in diabetes, we believe that this decrease in the circulation that feeds the skin layers might be a major contributor of hyperproliferation as seen  in the skin during diabetes.Abbreviations: miRNAs: MicroRNAs; PPP1R15B: PPP1R15B: Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 15B; TGFβR1: Transforming Growth Factor  Beta Receptor 1; ER: Endoplasmic Reticulum; Bip: Binding Immunoglobulin Protein;  Chop: CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein; p-eIF2α: Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2a; Bax: Bcl2-associated X protein; Bcl-2: B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2; PCNA: Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen; K5: Cytokeratin 5; qRT-PCR: Quantitative Real-Time PCR; ESCC: Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma; HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma; CTHRC1: Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1; SALL4: Sal-like protein 4; TNFα: Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha; PGC-1β: Peroxisome Profilerator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1β; IGF2BP1: Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1.

MicroRNA-500 (miR-500) is a potential prognostic biomarker in a number of different types of cancer, such as prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.  This study aimed to explore the clinical implications of miR-500 expression status in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). miR-500 expression status and clinical data were obtained from 74 patients with AML in the The Cancer Genome Atlas database receiving allo-HSCT. Patients with low expression level of  miR-500 (miR-500low) were significantly more likely to present with a French-American-British classification M2 subtype (P=0.003), and less likely to have the M5 subtype (P=0.040) compared with patients with high expression levels  (miR-500high). miR-500low patients were associated with low-risk AML (P=0.003) and core-binding factor subunit b-myosin heavy chain 11 translocation mutation (P=0.021). There was a significant difference in nucleophosmin 1 (P=0.009), NRAS  proto-oncogene GTPase/KRAS proto-oncogene GTPase (P=0.047) and PHD finger protein 6 (P=0.040) expression levels between the two groups. miR-500high patients had a  decreased overall survival (OS) time compared with the low expression group (P=0.035). Multivariate analysis revealed that miR-500 expression significantly affected OS time independent of other classical prognostic factors, such as age and common mutations. The analysis of survival curves further substantiated this  result. The results obtained in the current study suggested that miR-500 may be a suitable prognostic marker for patients with AML receiving allo-HSCT.  DOI: 10.3892/ol.2019.10250  PMCID: PMC6507407	31186809

The associations between Toll-like receptor 4 gene polymorphisms and hepatitis C  virus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Chaiwiang N(1), Poyomtip T(2).  Author information:  (1)Faculty of Optometry, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok, Thailand. (2)Faculty of Optometry, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok, Thailand tpteera075@gmail.com teera.p@ru.ac.th.  Background and objective: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is able to cause a life-threatening disease relating to lethal hepatocellular carcinoma. Previous, Toll-like receptor polymorphisms were proposed as promising biomarker for HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma and disease progression. This study aimed to summarize the association of TLR4 polymorphisms and HCV infection through meta-analysis.Methods: We applied a systematic review and meta-analysis performed by using PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science searches. The Modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for quality assessment. The odd-ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the association. In silico analysis was applied for proposing the function as microRNA (miRNA) of non-coding polymorphism. Finally, the miRNA target was predicted and annotated to suggest the possible relationship between polymorphism and HCV infection.Results: Our meta-analysis incorporated seven studies involving rs4986791, rs4986790 and rs2149356. No association exists between rs4986791 and HCV infection. However, the heterozygous model (AG vs GG) of rs4986790 significantly associates with HCV  infection (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.21-0.49, P<0.0001). Moreover, the rs2149356 TG genotype also associates with HCV infection in the over-dominant model (TG vs TT+TG: OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.40-0.75). In silico analysis of rs2149356G allele showed that this mutation is siRNA, which targets the set of genes, especially in the autophagy pathway.Conclusion: We demonstrated that rs4986790 and rs2149356 are associated with HCV infection.  © 2019 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: In a phase 3 trial (RESORCE), regorafenib increased overall survival compared with placebo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with sorafenib. In an exploratory study, we analyzed plasma and tumor samples from study participants to identify genetic, microRNA (miRNA),  and protein biomarkers associated with response to regorafenib. METHODS: We obtained archived tumor tissues and baseline plasma samples from patients with HCC given regorafenib in the RESORCE trial. Baseline plasma samples from 499 patients were analyzed for expression of 294 proteins (DiscoveryMAP) and plasma samples from 349 patients were analyzed for levels of 750 miRNAs (miRCURY  miRNA PCR). Tumor tissues from 7 responders and 10 patients who did not respond (progressors) were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (FoundationOne). Forty-six tumor tissues were analyzed for expression patterns of 770 genes involved in oncogenic and inflammatory pathways (PanCancer Immune Profiling). Associations between plasma levels of proteins and miRNAs and response to treatment (overall survival and time to progression) were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Decreased baseline plasma concentrations of 5 of 266 evaluable proteins  (angiopoietin 1, cystatin B, the latency-associated peptide of transforming growth factor beta 1, oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, and C-C motif  chemokine ligand 3; adjusted P ≤ .05) were significantly associated with increased overall survival time after regorafenib treatment. Levels of these 5 proteins, which have roles in inflammation and/or HCC pathogenesis, were not associated with survival independently of treatment. Only 20 of 499 patients had  high levels and a reduced survival time. Plasma levels of α-fetoprotein and c-MET were associated with poor outcome (overall survival) independently of regorafenib treatment only. We identified 9 plasma miRNAs (MIR30A, MIR122, MIR125B, MIR200A,  MIR374B, MIR15B, MIR107, MIR320, and MIR645) whose levels significantly associated with overall survival time with regorafenib (adjusted P ≤ .05). Functional analyses of these miRNAs indicated that their expression level associated with increased overall survival of patients with tumors of the Hoshida S3 subtype. Next-generation sequencing analyses of tumor tissues revealed 49 variants in 27 oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Mutations in CTNNB1 were detected in 3 of 10 progressors and VEGFA amplification in 1 of 7 responders. CONCLUSION: We identified expression patterns of plasma proteins and miRNAs that  associated with increased overall survival times of patients with HCC following treatment with regorafenib in the RESORCE trial. Levels of these circulating biomarkers and genetic features of tumors might be used to identify patients with HCC most likely to respond to regorafenib. ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01774344.

The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory networks involving long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), mRNA, genetic mutations and epigenetic  modifications in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by analyzing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. TCGA was mined, and miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs that were differentially expressed in HCC were identified using R software. A gene regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Representative genes were selected for functional enrichment analysis using Gene  Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The associations among various proteins and protein networks were identified using the online software Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. The cBioPortal database was used to analyze the association between genetic mutations and epigenetic modification, and the development of HCC. A total of 35 mRNAs were predicted to be targeted by 77 lncRNAs and 16 miRNAs, establishing a lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA regulatory network for HCC. Multivariable Cox regression analysis suggested that long intergenic non‑protein coding RNA 200, miRNA‑137, PDZ binding kinase and DNA polymerase θ were independent prognostic factors. In a regulatory network centered on miRNA‑424, six mRNA target genes were associated with HCC survival rates. Protein‑protein interaction analysis suggested that cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) interacted with centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55), claspin, E2F transcription factor 7 and cyclin E1 (CCNE1. Mutations in CEP55 affected overall survival and disease‑free survival in HCC, whereas, mutations in CDC25A affected overall survival, and mutations in E2F7 affected disease‑free survival. Decreased methylation levels of CEP55, CDC25A and CCNE1 were associated with vascular invasion. The survival rate of patients with hypermethylation of CCNE1 and CEP55 was significantly associated with the rate of methylation of these loci. The present study provides an integrated bioinformatics analysis of gene expression, genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications that may be associated with the development of HCC.

BACKGROUND: Splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3B4) is a splicing factor and potential oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, its regulatory mechanism is yet unclear. We aimed to determine the role of SF3B4 in HCC and the  underlying mechanism. METHODS: To investigate the association between alternative splicing events and miRNAs, putative miRNAs were screened using TargetScan. Expression levels of and  prognostic information for SF3B4 and miRNAs were determined based on public genomic data and clinical samples. Then, we examined the possible roles of SF3B4  and miRNA-133b in HCC cells and a xenograft mouse model. Pearson correlation analysis and in vitro experiments verified SF3B4 as a miRNA-133b target. Protein  levels of key targets from the SF3B4 signaling pathway were estimated using western blotting. FINDINGS: The expression of SF3B4 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines whereas, the expression of miRNA-133b was downregulated. MiRNA-133b negatively regulated the expression of SF3B4. Effects of SF3B4 overexpression were partially abolished by miRNA-133b mimics, confirming that SF3B4 is a target of miRNA-133b.  Moreover, molecules associated with SF3B4, including KLF4, KIP1, and SNAI2, were  also modulated by miRNA-133b. INTERPRETATION: SF3B4 plays a crucial role in HCC and is negatively regulated by  miRNA-133b. The miRNA-133b/ SF3B4 axis may serve as a new therapeutic target for  HCC treatment.

It is down-regulated in HCC, but the mechanism is not fully understood. MicroRNA-224 (miR-224) acts as an onco-miR in HCC. This study is the first to investigate miR-224 targeting the coding region of GNMT transcript. The GNMT-MT plasmid containing a miR-224 binding site silent mutation of the GNMT coding sequence can escape the suppression of miR-224 in HEK293T cells. Expression of both exogenous  and endogenous GNMT was suppressed by miR-224, while miR-224 inhibitor enhanced GNMT expression. miR-224 counteracts the effects of GNMT on the reduction of cell proliferation and tumor growth. The levels of miR-224 and GNMT mRNA showed a significant inverse relationship in tumor specimens from HCC patients. Utilizing  CCl4-treated hepatoma cells and mice as a cell damage of inflammatory or liver injury model, we observed that the decreased expression levels of GNMT were accompanied with the elevated expression levels of miR-224 in hepatoma cells and  mouse liver. Finally, hepatic AAV-mediated GNMT also reduced CCl4-induced miR-224 expression and liver fibrosis. These results indicated that AAV-mediated GNMT has potential liver protection activity. miR-224 can target the GNMT mRNA coding sequence and plays an important role in GNMT suppression during liver tumorigenesis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and participate in a variety of biological processes. The biogenesis of miRNAs is tightly controlled at multiple  steps, such as transcription of miRNA genes, processing by Drosha and Dicer, and  transportation of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 (XPO5). Given the critical role of nuclear export of pre-miRNAs in  miRNA biogenesis, any alterations of XPO5, resulting from either genetic mutation, epigenetic change, abnormal expression level or posttranslational modification, could affect miRNA expression and thus have profound effects on tumorigenesis. Importantly, XPO5 phosphorylation by ERK kinase and its cis/trans  isomerization by the prolyl isomerase Pin1 impair XPO5's nucleo-to-cytoplasmic transport ability of pre-miRNAs, leading to downregulation of mature miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we focus on how XPO5 transports pre-miRNAs in the cells and summarize the dysregulation of XPO5 in human tumors.  Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

The long noncoding RNA highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) is aberrantly elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and this up-regulation is crucial for HCC pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism in HULC up-regulation is poorly understood. We hypothesized that HULC might modulate the oncogene high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) to promote hepatocarcinogenesis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of HMGA2 in clinical HCC tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that HULC could up-regulate HMGA2 in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that the microRNA-186 inhibited HMGA2 expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HMGA2 mRNA. Strikingly, HULC acted as a competing noncoding RNA to sequester miR-186 and thereby relieved miR-186-mediated HMGA2 repression. Functionally, HMGA2 knockdown decreased the HULC-enhanced growth of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo We conclude that the long noncoding RNA HULC increases  HMGA2 expression by sequestering miR-186 post-transcriptionally and thereby promotes liver cancer growth, providing new insights into the mechanism by which  HULC enhances hepatocarcinogenesis.  © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

The transcriptional regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B4 and UGT2B7  has been well studied using liver cancer cell lines, and post-transcriptional regulation of these two UGTs by microRNA (miRNA/miR) miR-216b-5p was recently reported. This study describes novel miRNA-mediated regulation of UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 in liver cancer cells. Bioinformatic analyses identified a putative miR-3664-3p binding site in the UGT2B7 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and binding sites for both miR-135a-5p and miR-410-3p in the UGT2B4 3'-UTR. These sites were  functionally characterized using miRNA mimics and reporter constructs. A miR-3664-3p mimic induced repression of a luciferase reporter carrying the UGT2B7 3'-UTR in liver cancer cell lines; mutation of the miR-3664-3p site abrogated the response of the reporter to the mimic. Similarly, mutation of the miR-135a-5p site or miR-410-3p site in a luciferase reporter bearing UGT2B4 3'-UTR abrogated  the ability of miR-135a-5p or miR-410-3p mimics to reduce reporter activity. Transfection of miR-3664-3p mimics in HepG2 liver cancer cells significantly reduced mRNA and protein levels of UGT2B7, and this led to reduced enzymatic activity. Transfection of miR-135a-5p or miR-410-3p mimics significantly decreased UGT2B4 mRNA levels in Huh7 liver cancer cells. The expression levels of miR-410-3p were inversely correlated with UGT2B4 mRNA levels in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (371 specimens) and a panel of ten normal human tissues. Similarly, there was an inverse correlation between miR-135a and UGT2B4 mRNA levels in a panel of 18 normal human liver tissues. Together, these data suggest that miR-135a and miR-410 control UGT2B4 and that miR-3664 controls UGT2B7 expression in liver cancer and/or normal liver cells.

Accumulating evidence suggests that human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be derived from cancer stem cells (CSCs), which contribute to tumor initiation, metastasis, chemoresistance, and recurrence. A great variety of HCC CSCs resulting in diverse clinical manifestations have been reported. However, how CSC diversity is regulated and generated remains unclear. Here we report that the miR-200b-ZEB1 circuit is closely involved with the induction and maintenance of a diverse group of CSCs. We found that miR-200b downregulation occurred in early HCC and associated with poor prognosis. The downregulation was attributable to genome deletion and promoter methylation of the miR-200a/b/429 gene. Ectopic expression of miR-200b or silencing of ZEB1 led to a decrease in CD13+ and CD24+  HCC CSCs and an increase in EpCAM+ HCC CSCs. Mechanistically, miR-200b directly suppressed BMI1 and ZEB1 expressions. ZEB1 recognized promoters of CD13, CD24, and EpCAM genes resulting in CD13 and CD24 upregulation and EpCAM downregulation. Neither miR-200b nor ZEB1 had obvious effects on CD133 or CD90 expression. Silencing CD13 or CD24 expression suppressed tumorigenicity of HCC cells. Ectopic expression of CD24 reversed the suppression of tumorigenicity by ectopic expression of miR-200b. Clinically, miR-200b downregulation was coupled with ZEB1 upregulation in approximately two-thirds of HCC patients. ZEB1 expression was positively correlated with CD13 and CD24 expressions in HCCs, while miR-200b expression was positively correlated with EpCAM. Our findings suggest that the miR-200b-ZEB1 circuit is a master regulator of diverse stemness of HCC, which differentiates HCCs into those containing CD13+ /CD24+ CSCs from those containing EpCAM+ CSCs.  © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent modification present in the mRNAs of higher eukaryotes. YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2), an m6A "reader" protein, can recognize mRNA m6A sites to mediate mRNA degradation. However, the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF2 is poorly understood. To this end, we investigated the post-transcriptional regulation of YTHDF2. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the microRNA miR-145 might target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of YTHDF2 mRNA. The levels of miR-145 were negatively correlated with those of YTHDF2 mRNA  in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and immunohistochemical staining revealed that YTHDF2 was closely associated with malignancy of HCC. Interestingly, miR-145 decreased the luciferase activities of 3'-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA. Mutation of predicted miR-145 binding sites in the 3'-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA abolished the miR-145-induced decrease in luciferase activity. Overexpression of  miR-145 dose-dependently down-regulated YTHDF2 expression in HCC cells at the levels of both mRNA and protein. Conversely, inhibition of miR-145 resulted in the up-regulation of YTHDF2 in the cells. Dot blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that the overexpression of miR-145 strongly  increased m6A levels relative to those in control HCC cells, and this increase could be blocked by YTHDF2 overexpression. Moreover, miR-145 inhibition strongly  decreased m6A levels, which were rescued by treatment with a small interfering RNA-based YTHDF2 knockdown. Thus, we conclude that miR-145 modulates m6A levels by targeting the 3'-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA in HCC cells.  © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Although microRNAs have been implicated in tumor  development, the roles of miR-124 in HCC metastasis are still not well understood. We conducted functional analysis in this study to investigate miR-124. We observed that miR-124 significantly retarded the wound healing and migration of HCC SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells. Further analysis indicated miR-124 directly targeting the transcriptional factor Sp1 which is an important transcription factor for the integrin αV subunit gene transcription. Co-transfection of miR-124 with the luciferase reporter containing Sp1 3' untranslated region (UTR) significantly suppressed the luciferase activities. While mutation of the binding site of miR-124 in Sp1 mRNA 3'UTR completely abrogated the suppression of miR-124. Overexpression of miR-124 resulted in robust downregulation of Sp1 and integrin αV expression at either mRNA or protein level. Ectopic expression of miR-124 in HCC dramatically repressed the wound healing and migration in vitro and tumor metastasis in mouse experiments. Our findings demonstrated that miR-124 played as an important role in regulation of integrin αV expression in HCC, and reintroduction of miR-124 might be an alternative therapeutic strategy for controlling integrin αV expression in HCC.

Electronic address: jessica.zucman-rossi@inserm.fr.  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Growing evidence suggests that genetic predisposition significantly increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), independently from the presence of other risk factors. Here, we report a novel germline DICER1  mutation associated with familial recurrent liver tumors. We then aimed to investigate the contribution of constitutional and somatic DICER1 mutations on HCC occurrence. METHODS: We investigated two individuals of a single family that developed recurrent well-differentiated hepatocellular tumors over the years. Histological  slides from surgically resected tumors were reviewed. Exome sequencing was performed on constitutional DNA from circulating lymphocytes in both patients. The presence of somatic DICER1 mutations was analyzed in 243 liver tumors. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing was performed in 50 liver tumors to identify groups of tumors with similar profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). RESULTS: A pathological study identified hepatocellular adenomas and well-differentiated carcinomas in both patients. Tumors exhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, with strong and diffuse glutamine synthetase expression. Interestingly, non-tumor liver tissues showed abnormal liver zonation as previously reported in Dicer1 knockout mouse livers. Screening for DICER1 mutations in 243 sporadic liver tumors identified six tumors with somatic DICER1  mutations. In HCCs, DICER1 mutations were significantly associated with CTNNB1 mutations (p=0.03). miRNA profiling identified a specific expression profile in DICER1-mutated tumors with a decreased expression of mature miRNAs compared to the other samples. Among the DEMs, downregulation of let-7a and miR-365b was closely related to DICER1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the role of DICER1 mutations in liver carcinogenesis in a specific subtype of familial and sporadic hepatocellular carcinomas associated with β-catenin activation. LAY SUMMARY: DICER1 germline mutations are known to predispose individuals to the development of malignant tumors, mainly pleuropulmonary blastoma and ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. Here, we described familial HCC associated with a novel DICER1 germline mutation and altered liver zonation. Familial and sporadic  HCCs carrying DICER1 mutations are associated with CTNNB1 mutation and characterized by a reduced expression of specific mature miRNAs.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrying the rtA181T/sW172* mutation conferred cross-resistance to adefovir and lamivudine. Cell-based and clinical studies indicated that HBV carrying this mutation had an increased oncogenic potential. Herein, we created transgenic mouse models to study the oncogenicity of the HBV pre-S/S gene containing this mutation. Transgenic mice were generated by transfer of the HBV pre-S/S gene together with its own promoter into C57B6 mice. Four lines of mice were created. Two of them carried wild-type gene and produced high  and low levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) (TgWT-H and L). The other two carried the sW172* mutation with high and low intrahepatic expression levels (TgSW172*-H and L). When sacrificed 18 months after birth, none of the TgWT mice  developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), whereas 6/26 (23.1%) TgSW172*-H and 2/24 (8.3%) TgSW172*-L mice developed HCC (TgWT vs TgSW172*; P=0.0021). Molecular analysis of liver tissues revealed significantly increased expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 in TgSW172* mice, and decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large in TgSW172*-H mice. Higher proportion of apoptotic cells was found in TgSW172*-H mice, accompanied by increased cyclin E levels, suggesting increased hepatocyte turnover. Combined analysis of complimentary DNA microarray and microRNA array identified microRNA-873-mediated reduced expression of the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3 (CSMD3) protein, a putative tumor suppressor, in TgSW172* mice. Our transgenic mice experiments confirmed that HBV pre-S/S gene carrying the sW172* mutation had an increased oncogenic potential. Increased endoplasmic reticulum stress response, more rapid hepatocyte turnover and decreased CSMD3 expression contributed to the hepatocarcinogenesis.

Although it has showed that icaritin can apparently suppress growth of HCC by reducing the level of AFP, the intrinsic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we explored the possible mechanism of miRNAs on post-transcriptional regulation of AFP gene, as well as the effects of HBV infection and icaritin in hepatoma cells. The results showed that miR-620, miR-1236 and miR-1270 could bind target sites in the range of 9-18 nt and 131-151 nt downstream of the stop codon  in the AFP mRNA 3'-UTR to suppress the expression of AFP. Mutation of these target sites could reverse the effects of these miRNAs. Icaritin (10 μM) might reduce the stability and translational activity of AFP mRNA by increasing the expression levels of these mentioned miRNAs. HBV infection resulted in apparent decreases of these miRNAs and, consequently, increased AFP expression. The results indicated that miR-620, miR-1236 and miR-1270 are critical factors in the post-transcriptional regulation of AFP. Icaritin can counteract the effect of HBV. These findings will contribute to full understanding of the regulatory mechanism of AFP expression in hepatoma cells. And also it revealed a synergistic mechanism of HBV infection and elevation of AFP in the pathogenesis of HCC, as well as the potential clinical significance of icaritin on the therapy of HCC induced by HBV.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most deadly form of liver cancer. Chronic hepatitis and subsequent liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are the major causes of HCC. HBV infection results not only in HCC but also extra-hepatic cancers. However, the importance and approaches for HCC screening in HBV infected individuals, the risk factors of HCC, the possible mechanisms leading to HCC and  the potential therapeutic approaches of HBV-related HCC have less been systematic reviewed. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the screening, risk, new biomarker, mechanism and therapeutic of HBV-related HCC. RESULTS: Serum AFP should be used for the HCC screening in CHB patients. Higher HBV viral load is associated with increased risk of HCC. HBV genotype and genetic polymorphism contribute to the risk of HCC.Ku86, Ku86 antibody, miR-18a, miR-122  and miR-150 may be reliable markers of HBVrelated HCC. MicroRNAs and HBx play a key role in HBV-related HCC. Two types of drugs, conventional interferon (IFN), and nucleoside analogs (NAs), have recently become available for the treatment of CHB infection. However, treatment guidelines for these patients have not yet established. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive understanding of how HBV infection causes HCC is of great importance in developing more effective antiviral therapy and prevention of late stage consequences such as cirrhosis and HCC. Regular screening in HBV infected individuals is a practically useful approach in reducing the HCC incidence in these patients. More reliable markers for HCC early detection should be explored. Combining IFNs and NAs with other curative approaches have superior  benefits in preventing HCC recurrence.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by fat accumulation in liver, is closely associated with central obesity, over-nutrition and other features of metabolic syndrome, which elevate the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a significant role in the physiology and pathology of liver. Up to half of HCC patients have activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, the mutation frequencies of CTNNB1 (encoding β-catenin protein) or other antagonists targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling are low in HCC patients, suggesting that genetic mutations are not the major factor driving abnormal β-catenin activities in HCC.  Emerging evidence has demonstrated that obesity-induced metabolic pathways can deregulate chromatin modifiers such as histone deacetylase 8 to trigger undesired global epigenetic changes, thereby modifying gene expression program which contributes to oncogenic signaling. This review focuses on the aberrant epigenetic activation of Wnt/β-catenin in the development of NAFLD-associated HCC. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying such deregulation may shed light on the identification of novel druggable epigenetic targets for the prevention and/or treatment of HCC in obese and diabetic patients.

Xia J(1), Song P, Sun Z, Sawakami T, Jia M, Wang Z.  Author information:  (1)Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery Division, Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second major cause of cancerous deaths in the world, accounting for 80-90% of all cases  of liver cancer with an assessed global incidence of 782,000 new cases and approximate 746,000 deaths in 2012. Preoperative laboratory data (des-γ carboxyprothrombin (DCP), α-fetoprotein (AFP), Indocyanine green retention 15 min (ICG-R15), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT)) should be completely assessed before deciding a treatment and predicting prognosis in order to improve the prognosis for patients with HCC. A few recent studies have suggested GGT as an independent  prognostic indicator in cases with HCC. And the data of our and other research teams revealed that combination of GGT and ICG-R15 or other factors may improve the efficiency of GGT as a prognostic predictor. In addition of clinical studies, a few mechanistic studies had been performed and GGT was suggested to promote tumor progression and poor prognosis through inducing DNA damage and genome instability, releasing reactive oxygen species to activating invasion-related signaling pathway, blocking chemotherapy, regulating microRNAs, and managing CpG  island methylation. Although there were a few mechanistic studies, further and accurate researches were still in need.  DOI: 10.5582/ddt.2016.01052 	27534452

Author information:  (1)Hong Kim, Seoung-Ae Lee, Bum-Joon Kim, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Microbiology and Immunology, Liver Research Institute and Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Chongno-gu, Seoul 110-799, South Korea.  Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem, with more than 240 million people chronically infected worldwide and potentially 650000 deaths per year due to advanced liver diseases including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV-X protein (HBx) contributes to the biology and pathogenesis of HBV via stimulating virus replication or altering host gene expression related to HCC. The HBV X region contains only 465 bp encoding the 16.5 kDa HBx protein, which also contains several critical cis-elements such as enhancer II, the core promoter and the microRNA-binding region. Thus, mutations in this region may affect not only the HBx open reading frame but also the overlapped cis-elements. Recently, several types of HBx mutations significantly associated with clinical severity have been described, although the functional mechanism in most of these cases remains unsolved. This review article will mainly focus on the HBx mutations proven to be significantly  related to clinical severity via epidemiological studies.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in virtually all cancer types, including digestive cancers. Herein, we aggregated and systematically analyzed miRNA expression profiles of 1765 tumor samples, including esophageal, gastric, liver, pancreatic, colon and rectal cancers, obtained through small RNA sequencing by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found that digestive cancers of different tissue origins could be differentiated according to their miRNA expression profiles. In particular, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma exhibited distinct miRNA expression patterns. Thirteen  (e.g. miR-135b, miR-182) and sixteen (e.g. miR-139, miR-133a-1, miR-490) miRNAs were commonly upregulated and downregulated in more than four cancer types, respectively. Pertinent to pathological features, low miR-181d expression was associated with microsatellite instability in colon and gastric cancers whereas low miR-106a expression was associated with hepatitis B virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma. Progression in colon cancer could also be predicted by  low let-7f-2 and high miR-106a expression. Molecular subtypes with distinct prognostic outcomes independent of tumor-node-metastasis staging were identified  in hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer. In total, 4 novel and 6 reported associations between specific miRNAs and patients' survival were identified. Collectively, novel miRNA markers were identified to stratify digestive cancers with different pathological features and survival outcomes.  DOI: 10.1038/srep24466  PMCID: PMC4832245	27080237

Different types of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core gene deletion mutants were identified in chronic hepatitis B patients. However, their clinical roles in different stages of natural chronic HBV infection remained unclear. To address this issue, HBV core genes were sequenced in three gender- and age-matched patient groups diagnosed as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. Functional analysis of the identified mutants was  performed. A novel type of large-fragment core gene deletion (LFCD) was identified exclusively in HCC patients and significantly associated with unfavorable postoperative survival. The presence of LFCDs resulted in generation  of precore-polymerase fusion protein or brought the polymerase reading frame under direct control of HBV precore/core promoter, leading to its over-expression. Enhanced cell proliferation and increased tumorigenicity in nude mice were found in hepatoma cells expressing LFCDs. Because of the epsilon-binding ability of HBV polymerase, we hypothesized that the over-expressed polymerase carrying aberrant amino-terminal sequence could bind to cellular microRNAs. Screening of a panel of microRNAs revealed physical association of a precore-polymerase fusion protein with microRNA-100. A binding inhibition effect on microRNA-100 by the precore-polymerase fusion protein with up-regulation of its target, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), was discovered. The binding inhibition and growth promoting effects could be reversed by overexpressing microRNA-100. Together, HCC patients carrying hepatitis B large-fragment core gene deletion mutants had an unfavorable postoperative prognosis. The growth promoting effect was partly due to polymerase overexpression, leading to binding inhibition of microRNA-100 and up-regulation of PLK1.

There are various histological types of GBC, and the vast majority of GBC cases are adenocarcinomas. Squamous and adenosquamous carcinomas are rare GBC subtypes that are traditionally considered to be more aggressive and to be associated with a poorer prognosis than adenocarcinoma. Galectin-9 (Gal-9), a tandem-repeat-type galectin, has been reported to induce apoptosis-mediated elimination of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and hematologic malignancies. Therefore, we investigated the  antitumor effects of Gal-9 on GBC in vitro and in vivo. In our in vitro experiments, Gal-9 suppressed cell proliferation in various GBC cell lines but not in the OCUG-1 cell line, which represents a poorly differentiated type of adenosquamous carcinoma. Gal-9 induced the apoptosis of Gal-9-sensitive GBC cells by increasing the levels of caspase-cleaved keratin 18 and phosphorylated p53. However, Gal-9 did not affect the expression of various cell cycle-related proteins. In addition, Gal-9 suppressed tumor growth by implanted human GBC cells in a xenograft model. Furthermore, Gal-9 induced the phosphorylation of the Ephrin type-B receptor, and the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile was markedly  altered by Gal-9. Based on these results, various miRNAs might contribute to the  suppression of tumor growth. Our data reveal that Gal-9 suppresses the growth of  GBC, possibly by inducing apoptosis and altering miRNA expression. Thus, Gal-9 might serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of GBC.

Author information:  (1)Ming Geng, Xuan Xin, Li-Quan Bi, Lu-Ting Zhou, Xiao-Hong Liu, Department of Pathology, General Hospital of Jinan Military Command, Jinan 250031, Shandong Province, China.  Many factors are considered to contribute to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including products of HBV, HBV integration and mutation, and host susceptibility. HBV X protein (HBx) can interfere with several signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation and invasion, and HBx C-terminal truncation has been suggested to impact the development of HCC. This review focuses on the pathological functions of HBx in HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. As a transactivator, HBx can affect regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs and long ncRNAs. HBx is also involved in epigenetic modification and DNA repair. HBx interacts with various signal-transduction pathways, such as the p53, Wnt, and nuclear factor-κB pathways. We conclude that HBx hastens the development of hepatoma.

The altered expression of some microRNAs (miRNAs) is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the genetic polymorphisms in the precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-related HCC have not yet been investigated. A hospital-based case-control study, including 1,706 HCC cases and 2,270 controls without any liver diseases or tumors, was conducted in a high AFB1 exposure area  of China to assess the relationship between 48 polymorphisms in the pre-miRNAs and AFB1-related HCC risk and prognosis. Among 48 polymorphisms, only rs28599926  (in the miRNA 1268a) affected HCC risk. Compared with the homozygote of rs28599926C alleles (rs28599926-CC), the genotypes of rs28599926 T alleles (namely rs28599926-CT or -TT) increased HCC risk (odds ratio [OR]: 1.63 and 5.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-1.90 and 4.27-7.14, respectively). Significant interactive effects between risk genotypes and AFB1 exposure status were also observed in the joint effects analysis. This polymorphism was associated not only with larger tumor size, higher portal vein tumor risk, and tumor dedifferentiation, but also with higher AFB1 adducts levels and increasing the mutation risk of TP53 gene. Furthermore, rs28599926 modified the tumor recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.36-3.43) and overall survival (HR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.86-2.41) of cases. Additionally, one target of miR-1268a was show to be the ADAMTS4 mRNA and rs28599926 polymorphism might modify ADAMTS4 expression. These findings indicate that polymorphisms in the pre-miRNAs may be risk and prognostic biomarkers of AFB1-related HCC, and rs28599926 in miR-1268a is such a potential candidate. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals,  Inc.  © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Vascular invasion provides a direct route for tumor metastasis. The degree to which microRNA (miRNA) expression plays a role in tumor vascular invasion is unclear. Here, we report that miR-494 is up-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors with vascular invasion and can promote HCC cell invasiveness by gene inactivation of multiple invasion-suppressor miRNAs. Our results show that ten eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase, predominantly TET1 in HCC cells, is a direct target of miR-494. The reduced 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine levels observed in the proximal cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) regions of multiple invasion-suppressor miRNA genes are strongly associated with their transcriptional repression upon miR-494  overexpression, whereas enforced DNA demethylation can abolish the repression. Furthermore, TET1 knockdown shows a similar effect as miR-494 overexpression. Conversely, miR-494 inhibition or enforced TET1 expression is able to restore invasion-suppressor miRNAs and inhibit miR-494-mediated HCC cell invasion.CONCLUSIONS: miR-494 can trigger gene silencing of multiple invasion-suppressor miRNAs by inhibiting genomic DNA demethylation by direct targeting of TET1, thereby leading to tumor vascular invasion.  © 2015 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary tumour of the liver. About a third of these tumours presents activating mutations of the β-catenin gene. The molecular pathogenesis of HCC has been elucidated, but mortality remains high, and new therapeutic approaches, including treatments based on microRNAs, are required. We aimed to identify candidate microRNAs, regulated by β-catenin, potentially involved in liver tumorigenesis. DESIGN: We used a mouse model, in which β-catenin signalling was overactivated exclusively in the liver by the tamoxifen-inducible and Cre-Lox-mediated inactivation of the Apc gene. This model develops tumours with properties similar to human HCC. RESULTS: We found that miR-34a was regulated by β-catenin, and significantly induced by the overactivation of β-catenin signalling in mouse tumours and in patients with HCC. An inhibitor of miR-34a (locked nucleic acid, LNA-34a) exerted antiproliferative activity in primary cultures of hepatocyte. This inhibition of  proliferation was associated with a decrease in cyclin D1 levels, orchestrated principally by HNF-4α, a target of miR-34a considered to act as a tumour suppressor in the liver. In vivo, LNA-34a approximately halved progression rates  for tumours displaying β-catenin activation together with an activation of caspases 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the key oncogenic role of miR-34a in liver tumours with β-catenin gene mutations. We suggest that patients diagnosed with HCC with β-catenin mutations could be treated with an inhibitor of miR-34a. The potential value of this strategy lies in the modulation of the tumour suppressor  HNF-4α, which targets cyclin D1, and the induction of a proapoptotic programme.

Electronic address: frankch@cuhk.edu.hk.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major risk factor of HCC. The virus encodes HBV X (HBx) protein that plays a critical role in the development of HCC. Studies have revealed numerous HBx-altered genes and signalling pathways  that heavily contribute to tumourigenesis of non-tumour hepatocytes. However, the role of HBx in regulating other critical gene regulators such as microRNAs is poorly understood, which impedes the exploration of a complete HBx-associated carcinogenic network. Besides, critical microRNAs that drive the transformation of non-tumour hepatocytes are yet to be identified. Here, we overexpressed C-terminal truncated HBx protein in a non-tumour hepatocyte cell line MIHA, and measured a panel of cancer-associated miRNAs. We observed that oncogenic miR-21 was upregulated upon ectopic expression of this viral protein variant. HBx-miR-21 pathway was prevalent in HCC cells as inhibition of HBx in Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells significantly suppressed miR-21 expression. Subsequently, we showed that the upregulation of miR-21 was mediated by HBx-induced interleukin-6 pathway followed by activation of STAT3 transcriptional factor. The high dependency of miR-21 expression to HBx protein suggested a unique viral oncogenic pathway that  could aberrantly affect a network of gene expression. Importantly, miR-21 was essential in the HBx-induced transformation of non-tumour hepatocytes. Inhibition of miR-21 effectively attenuated anchorage-independent colony formation and subcutaneous tumour growth of MIHA cells. Our study suggested that overexpression of miR-21 was critical to promote early carcinogenesis of hepatocytes upon HBV infection.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Elevated p53 promotes the processing of miR-18a to decrease estrogen receptor-α in female hepatocellular carcinoma.  Li CL(1), Yeh KH, Liu WH, Chen CL, Chen DS, Chen PJ, Yeh SH.  Author information:  (1)Department of Microbiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.  The estrogen pathway has long been implicated as a tumor protector in female hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study identified that estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) protein is downregulated in 60% of female HCC cases, via a miR-18a elevation mediated suppression of ERα translation. This study aims to delineate the mechanism underlying the upregulation of miR-18a in female HCC. The analysis of 77 female HCC specimens revealed that miR-18a levels were associated with pre-miR-18a rather than pri-miR-18a levels, suggesting an enhanced processing of pri- to pre-miR-18a. Among a panel of factors involved in microRNA processing, p53 was identified as a novel regulator for miR-18a maturation process. Knockdown of p53 by si-RNA decreased the level of miR-18a, whereas overexpression of either wild-type or mutant p53 increased its level. The association between the elevation of miR-18a  and the accumulation of p53, mainly caused by somatic mutations, was confirmed in the clinical specimens of HBV-related female HCC. By analyzing the association with clinicopathological features, activation of this p53/miR-18a pathway mainly  occurs in younger or noncirrhosis female HCC patients and associated with a trend of worse overall survival. Therefore, this study demonstrated a novel function of elevated/mutant p53 in regulating the amount of ERα protein through its promoting the biogenesis of miR-18a, which could lead to decrease the tumor-protective function of the estrogen pathway in female hepatocarcinogenesis.  © 2014 UICC.

Hepatic fibrosis is a wound-healing response to various chronic stimuli, including viral hepatitis B or C infection. Activated myofibroblasts, predominantly derived from the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), regulate the balance between matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors to maintain extracellular matrix homeostasis. Transforming growth factor-β and platelet-derived growth factor are classic profibrogenic signals that activate HSC proliferation. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines coordinate macrophages, T cells, NK/NKT cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in complex fibrogenic and regression processes. In addition, fibrogenesis involves angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, autophagy, microRNA, and epigenetic regulations. Hepatic inflammation is the driving force behind liver fibrosis; however, host single nucleotide polymorphisms and viral factors, including the genotype, viral load, viral mutation, and viral proteins, have been associated with fibrosis progression. Eliminating the underlying etiology is the  most crucial antifibrotic therapy. Growing evidence has indicated that persistent viral suppression with antiviral therapy can result in fibrosis regression, reduced liver disease progression, decreased hepatocellular carcinoma, and improved chances of survival. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are currently examining several investigational agents that target key fibrogenic pathways; the results are promising and shed light on this debilitating illness.

Application of microRNA and mRNA expression profiling on prognostic biomarker discovery for hepatocellular carcinoma.  Wei L, Lian B, Zhang Y, Li W, Gu J, He X, Xie L.  BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most highly malignant and lethal cancers of the world. Its pathogenesis has been reported to be multi-factorial, and the molecular carcinogenesis of HCC can not be attributed to just a few individual genes. Based on the microRNA and mRNA expression profiling  of normal liver tissues, pericancerous hepatocellular tissues and hepatocellular  carcinoma tissues, we attempted to find prognosis related gene sets for HCC patients. RESULTS: We identified differentially expressed genes (DEG) from three comparisons: Cancer/Normal, Cancer/Pericancerous and Pericancerous/Normal. GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis) were performed. Based on the enriched gene sets of GO terms, pathways and transcription factor targets, it was found that the genome instability and cell proliferation increased while the metabolism and differentiation decreased in HCC tissues. The expression profile of DEGs in each  enriched gene set was used to correlate to the postoperative survival time of HCC patients. Nine gene sets were found to prognostic correlation. Furthermore, after substituting DEG-targeting-microRNA for DEG members of each gene set, two gene sets with the microRNA expression profiles were obtained that had prognostic potential. CONCLUSIONS: The malignancy of HCC could be represented by gene sets, and pericancerous liver exhibits important characteristics of liver cancer. The expression level of gene sets not only in HCC but also in the pericancerous liver showed potential for prognosis implying an option for HCC prognosis at an early stage. Additionally, the gene-targeting-microRNA expression profiles also showed  prognostic potential, demonstrating that the multi-factorial molecular pathogenesis of HCC is contributed by various genes and microRNAs.

Author information:  (1)Department of Epidemiology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.  BACKGROUND & AIMS: MicroRNA-218 (miR-218) can function as a tumour suppressor and inactivate cancer-promoting inflammation. However, role of miR-218 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. To determine the contribution of  miR-218 genetic predisposition and its interaction with hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations to HCC risk. METHODS: rs11134527 located at putative promoter region of pre-miR-218 was genotyped in 1012 healthy controls, 302 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects and 2011 subjects with chronic HBV infection (1021 with HCC) using quantitative PCR. HBV mutation was determined by sequencing. RESULTS: rs11134527 variant genotypes in dominant model was associated with HCC risk compared with all HCC-free subjects [odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence  interval (CI) = 1.04-1.43], HCC-free HBsAg-positive subjects (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.02-1.50) and HBsAg seroclearance subjects (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.08-1.96), adjusting for age and gender, and also associated with the generation of HBV preS deletion in men (adjusted OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.23-2.76). In multivariate regression analyses, rs11134527 in dominant model was associated with HCC risk (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.05-2.13), whereas its multiplicative interaction with viral mutation T1674C/G was inversely associated with HCC risk (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.21-0.96), adjusting for covariates including HBV mutations in the enhancer II-precore region; its interaction with HBV preS1 start codon mutation was associated with HCC risk (OR = 4.44, 95% CI = 1.27-15.55), adjusting for covariates including HBV mutations in the preS region. CONCLUSION: rs11134527 may be a novel genetic risk factor of HCC in HBV-exposed subjects, can facilitate HBV preS deletion generation and predispose the host to  the effect of T1674C/G and preS1 start codon mutation in hepatocarcinogenesis.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

MicroRNA-433 inhibits liver cancer cell migration by repressing the protein expression and function of cAMP response element-binding protein.  Yang Z(1), Tsuchiya H, Zhang Y, Hartnett ME, Wang L.  Author information:  (1)From the Departments of Medicine and Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah School of Medicine, and.  We show for the first time that potent microRNA-433 (miR-433) inhibition of expression of the cAMP response element-binding protein CREB1 represses hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell migration. We identified a miR-433 seed match region in human and mouse CREB1 3'-UTRs. Overexpression of miR-433 markedly decreased human CREB1 3'-UTR reporter activity, and the inhibitory effect of miR-433 was alleviated upon mutation of its binding site. Ectopic expression of miR-433 reduced CREB1 protein levels in a variety of human and mouse cancer cells, including HeLa, Hepa1, Huh7, and HepG2. Human CREB1 protein levels in highly invasive MHCC97H cells were diminished by expression of miR-433 but were induced by miR-433 antagomir (anti-miR-433). The expression of mouse CREB1 protein negatively correlated with miR-433 levels in nuclear receptor Shp(-/-) liver tissues and liver tumors compared with wild-type mice. miR-433 exhibited a  significant repression of MHCC97H cell migration, which was reversed by anti-miR-433. Overexpressing miR-433 inhibited focus formation dramatically, demonstrating that miR-433 may exert a tumor suppressor function. Knockdown of CREB1 by siRNAs impeded MHCC97H cell migration and invasion and antagonized the effect of anti-miR-433. Interestingly, CREB1 siRNA decreased MHCC97H cell proliferation, which was not influenced by anti-miR-433. Overexpressing CREB1 decreased the inhibitory activity of miR-433. The CpG islands surrounding miR-433 were hypermethylated, and the DNA methylation agent 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, but  not the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, drastically stimulated the  expression of miR-433 and miR-127 in HCC cells. The latter is clustered with miR-433. The results reveal a critical role of miR-433 in mediating HCC cell migration via CREB1.  DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M113.502682  PMCID: PMC3789984	23979134

Association between an insertion/deletion polymorphism within 3'UTR of SGSM3 and  risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.  Wang C(1), Zhao H, Zhao X, Wan J, Wang D, Bi W, Jiang X, Gao Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Forensic Medicine, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary hepatic malignancy, and multiple host genetic factors are believed to contribute to HCC development. The  small G protein signaling modulator 3 (SGSM3) has been shown to be associated with small G protein coupled receptor signal transduction pathway, suggesting a potential role in HCC susceptibility. We carried out a case-control study in a Chinese population (502 cases and 513 controls) to determine whether the 4-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs56228771) in 3' untranslated region of SGSM3 could affect HCC susceptibility. Logistic regression analysis showed that compared with the del/del genotype, the ins/del genotype of rs56228771 was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HCC [adjusted odd ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.42-0.73, P = 1.93 × 10(-5)]. The combined ins/del + ins/ins genotypes contributed to a 45% decreased HCC risk (95% CI = 0.42-0.73, P = 1.03 × 10(-5)). This protective trend was more prominent in the HBsAg-negative subgroup. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that mRNA levels of SGSM3 from HCC tumor tissues and adjacent non-HCC tissues were correlated with rs56228771 genotypes. Tissue samples with ins/ins genotype have the highest level of SGSM3, which are 2.85-3.00-fold and 1.46-1.57-fold higher than that with ins/del and del/del genotype, respectively. Similar results were also observed with four common hepatoma cell lines in vitro. In addition, compared with HCC tissues, significantly higher SGSM3 expression was observed in  adjacent non-HCC tissues (fold change = 2.48), implying its tumor suppressor roles in HCC. Bioinformatics prediction showed that the insertion allele disrupted a binding site for microRNA (miRNA)-151-5p, which would upregulate SGSM3. Taken together, we provided initial evidence that rs56228771 may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis, possibly by affecting SGSM3 expression through a miRNA-mediated regulation. The replication of our studies in other populations and functional analysis will further strengthen the underlining mechanism.  DOI: 10.1007/s13277-013-1039-x 	23918301

Fu X(1), Tan D, Hou Z, Hu Z, Liu G, Ouyang Y, Liu F.  Author information:  (1)Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, P.R. China.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide.  Although numerous studies have suggested the potentially oncogenic roles of wild‑type or mutant hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein in hepatocarcinogenesis, their exact mechanism remains unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in embryogenesis, cell differentiation and carcinogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of HBx on the miRNA expression profile of LO2 cells. We established the LO2 cell line transfected with recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.0/HBx-d382, pcDNA/HBx and plasmid pcDNA3.0 using Lipofectamine™ 2000, which was confirmed by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. We then demonstrated the miRNA expression profiles in the stably transfected LO2 cells using a mammalian miRNA microarray containing whole‑human mature and precursor miRNA sequences. The results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that a stably HBx‑transfected LO2 cell line had been successfully established. According to the microarray, compared to  LO2/pcDNA3.0 cells, 6 miRNAs were shown to have higher expression and 5 were shown to have decreased expression in LO2/HBx-d382 cells, while 4 up- and 12 downregulated miRNAs were observed in LO2/HBx cells. There were 8 different expression patterns of miRNAs between LO2/HBx and LO2/HBx-d382 cells. All the chip results were consistent with the real‑time PCR data. Consequently, the HBx gene may influence the miRNA expression profile of LO2 cells. Thus, it may be helpful to further investigate the role of HBx in hepatocarcinogenesis and clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.  DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2012.1203 	23184160

The let-7 microRNA enhances heme oxygenase-1 by suppressing Bach1 and attenuates  oxidant injury in human hepatocytes.  Hou W(1), Tian Q, Steuerwald NM, Schrum LW, Bonkovsky HL.  Author information:  (1)The Liver-Biliary-Pancreatic Center, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC,  USA. weihong.hou@carolinashealthcare.org  The let-7 microRNA (miRNA) plays important roles in human liver development and diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, liver fibrosis and hepatitis wherein oxidative stress accelerates the progression of these diseases. To date, the role of the let-7 miRNA family in modulation of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), a key cytoprotective enzyme, remains unknown. Our aims were to determine whether let-7  miRNA directly regulates Bach1, a transcriptional repressor of the HMOX1 gene, and whether indirect up-regulation of HMOX1 by let-7 miRNA attenuates oxidant injury in human hepatocytes. The effects of let-7 miRNA on Bach1 and HMOX1 gene expression in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells were determined by real-time qRT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase reporter assays. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that let-7b, let-7c, or miR-98 significantly decreased Bach1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR)-dependent luciferase activity but not mutant Bach1 3'-UTR-dependent luciferase activity, whereas mutant let-7 miRNA containing base  complementarity with mutant Bach1 3'-UTR restored its effect on mutant reporter activity. let-7b, let-7c, or miR-98 down-regulated Bach1 protein levels by 50-70%, and subsequently up-regulated HMOX1 gene expression by 3-4 fold, compared with non-specific controls. Furthermore, Huh-7 cells transfected with let-7b, let-7c or miR-98 mimic showed increased resistance against oxidant injury induced by tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (tBuOOH), whereas the protection was abrogated by over-expression of Bach1. In conclusion, let-7 miRNA directly acts on the 3'-UTR  of Bach1 and negatively regulates expression of this protein, and thereby up-regulates HMOX1 gene expression. Over-expression of the let-7 miRNA family members may represent a novel approach to protecting human hepatocytes from oxidant injury.  Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Expression of microRNA miR-122 facilitates an efficient replication in nonhepatic cells upon infection with hepatitis C virus.  Fukuhara T(1), Kambara H, Shiokawa M, Ono C, Katoh H, Morita E, Okuzaki D, Maehara Y, Koike K, Matsuura Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Molecular Virology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most common etiologic agents of chronic liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, HCV infection is often associated with extrahepatic manifestations (EHM), including mixed cryoglobulinemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the  mechanisms of cell tropism of HCV and HCV-induced EHM remain elusive, because in  vitro propagation of HCV has been limited in the combination of cell culture-adapted HCV (HCVcc) and several hepatic cell lines. Recently, a liver-specific microRNA called miR-122 was shown to facilitate the efficient propagation of HCVcc in several hepatic cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the importance of miR-122 on the replication of HCV in nonhepatic cells. Among the nonhepatic cell lines expressing functional HCV entry receptors, Hec1B cells  derived from human uterus exhibited a low level of replication of the HCV genome  upon infection with HCVcc. Exogenous expression of miR-122 in several cells facilitates efficient viral replication but not production of infectious particles, probably due to the lack of hepatocytic lipid metabolism. Furthermore, expression of mutant miR-122 carrying a substitution in a seed domain was required for efficient replication of mutant HCVcc carrying complementary substitutions in miR-122-binding sites, suggesting that specific interaction between miR-122 and HCV RNA is essential for the enhancement of viral replication. In conclusion, although miR-122 facilitates efficient viral replication in nonhepatic cells, factors other than miR-122, which are most likely specific to hepatocytes, are required for HCV assembly.

Androgen pathway stimulates microRNA-216a transcription to suppress the tumor suppressor in lung cancer-1 gene in early hepatocarcinogenesis.  Chen PJ(1), Yeh SH, Liu WH, Lin CC, Huang HC, Chen CL, Chen DS, Chen PJ.  Author information:  (1)Department of Microbiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.  Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is common in advanced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the ones involved in early carcinogenesis have not yet  been investigated. By examining the expression of 22 HCC-related miRNAs between precancerous and cancerous liver tissues, we found miR-216a and miR-224 were significantly up-regulated, starting from the precancerous stage. Furthermore, the elevation of miR-216a was mainly identified in male patients. To study this gender difference, we demonstrated that pri-miR-216a is activated transcriptionally by the androgen pathway in a ligand-dependent manner and is further enhanced by the hepatitis B virus X protein. The transcription initiation site for pri-miR-216a was delineated, and one putative androgen-responsive element site was identified within its promoter region. Mutation of this site abolished the elevation of pri-miR-216a by the androgen pathway. One target of miR-216a was shown to be the tumor suppressor in lung cancer-1 gene (TSLC1) messenger RNA (mRNA) through the three target sites at its 3' untranslated region. Finally, the androgen receptor level increased in male liver tissues during hepatocarcinogenesis, starting from the precancerous stage, with a concomitant elevation of miR-216a but a decrease of TSLC1.CONCLUSION: The current study discovered the up-regulation of miRNA-216a by the androgen pathway and a subsequent suppression of TSLC1 as a new mechanism for the androgen pathway in early hepatocarcinogenesis.

The mitochondrial DNA 9-bp deletion polymorphism is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in the Chinese population.  Jin Y(1), Yu Q, Zhou D, Chen L, Huang X, Xu G, Huang J, Gao X, Gao Y, Shen L.  Author information:  (1)Department of Vascular/Interventional Radiology, Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Suzhou, P.R. China.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide.  Although molecular biology of carcinogenesis and tumor progression of HCC has been increasingly understood with intense research in recent years, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HCC pathogenesis are still poorly understood. In the present study, a case-control study including 390 HCC patients and 431 healthy controls was conducted to investigate the association of HCC susceptibility with  the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 9-bp deletion polymorphism in Chinese population. Chi-square testing showed that frequencies of 9-bp one repeat or two repeats were significantly different between HCC and control groups. Carriage of 9-bp one repeat fragment was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing  HCC (odds ratio=1.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.14, p=0.027). Stratification analysis further showed that the differences between cases and controls were more obvious in drinkers than nondrinkers. Computational modeling of the 9-bp deletion polymorphism suggests that the mtDNA sequence without the 9-bp deletion polymorphism lies within a predicted binding site (seed region) for hsa-miR-519c-5p and hsa-miR-526a. Our data suggested that the 9-bp deletion polymorphism in mitochondria may influence HCC risk, likely through specific microRNA-mediated regulation, which was possibly involved in the pathogenesis of  HCC. The replication of our studies in other populations with larger sample size  is warranted.  DOI: 10.1089/gtmb.2011.0208  PMCID: PMC3354583	22283196

MicroRNA-122 suppresses cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma by directly targeting Wnt/β-catenin pathway.  Xu J(1), Zhu X, Wu L, Yang R, Yang Z, Wang Q, Wu F.  Author information:  (1)Department of Oncological Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.  Comment in     Liver Int. 2012 May;32(5):695-7.  AIMS: To validate whether the anti-cancer effect of microRNA-122 (miR-122) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mediated through regulating Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways. METHODS: The expression levels of miR-122 in HCC tissues and varied hepatoma cells were quantified by real-time PCR. MiR-122 agomir was transfected into HepG2, Hep3B cells to over-express miR-122. The effect of over-expression miR-122 on proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 and Hep3B cells was evaluated using CCK-8 kit and flow cytometer respectively. The 3'-UTR segments of Wnt1 containing the miR-122 binding sites were amplified by PCR and the luciferase activity in the transfected cells was assayed. Wnt1 mRNA level was quantified using RT-PCR. Protein levels of Wnt1, β-catenin and TCF-4 were detected using Western blotting. RESULTS: In comparison with the expression level of miR-122 in para-cancerous tissues or Chang liver cell, the expression level in HCC tissues or varied hepatoma cells was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Over-expression of miR-122 significantly inhibited the proliferation (P < 0.05), and promoted the apoptosis  of HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Over-expressed miR-122 down-regulated the protein levels of Wnt1, β-catenin and TCF-4 (P < 0.05). MiR-122 suppressed the luciferase activity of the pmiR-Wnt1-wt by approximately 50% compared with the negative control, while mutation or removal of the miR-122 binding site using siRNA or mir-122 inhibitor blocked the suppressive effect (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MiR-122 expression is down-regulated in human HCC. Over-expression of miR-122 inhibits HCC cell growth and promotes the cell apoptosis by affecting  Wnt/β-catenin-TCF signalling pathway.  © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and the incidence of this fatal disease is still on rise. The majority of HCCs emerge in the background of a chronic liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. The current understanding is that majority of HCCs evolve as a consequence of chronic inflammation and due to the presence of infection with hepatitis viruses. These underlying pathogenic stimuli subsequently induce a spectrum of genetic and epigenetic alterations in several cancer-related genes, which are involved in cell-cycle regulation, cell growth and adhesion. Such widespread genomic alterations cause disruption of normal cellular signaling and finally lead to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in HCC. In general, the type of gene alterations, such as point mutations, deletion of chromosomal regions and abnormal methylation of gene promoters differ according to the individual targeted gene. In HCC, incidence of genetic alterations is relatively rare and is limited to a subset of few cancer-specific  genes, such as the tumor suppressor p53, RB genes and oncogenes such as the CTNNB1. In contrast, epigenetic changes that involve aberrant methylation of genes and other post-transcriptional histone modifications occur far more frequently, and some of these epigenetic alterations are now being exploited for  the development of molecular diagnostic signatures for HCC. In addition, recent findings of unique microRNA expression profiles also provide an evidence for the  existence of novel mechanisms for gene expression regulation in HCC. In this review article, we will review the current state of knowledge on the activation of various oncogenic pathways and the inactivation of tumor suppressor pathways in HCC that result in the disruption of cancer-related gene function. In addition, we will specifically emphasize the clinical implication of some of these genetic and epigenetic alterations in the management of hepatocarcinogenesis.

Molecular classification of hepatocellular carcinoma anno 2011.  van Malenstein H(1), van Pelt J, Verslype C.  Author information:  (1)Department of Hepatology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg Leuven, Belgium. Hannah.vanmalenstein@med.kuleuven.be  Hepatocellular carcinoma has an increasing incidence and high mortality. Treatment options are limited if the disease is not diagnosed in its early stage. The natural course of the disease is aggressive but not always predictable. Molecular profiling is a promising tool for classification in order to optimize prognosis prediction and treatment for an individual patient. In the last decade  a large amount of studies has been conducted to better classify hepatocellular carcinomas. The focus of this review is on implications of molecular classification for prognosis and therapeutic decision making in HCC patients. Most studies used microarray technique for genome wide profiling, but other methods to detect genomic changes and microRNA are gaining interest. The whole genome profiling studies identified differences in affected signalling and tried  to relate this to prognosis. Some common subgroups were identified, such as the proliferation cluster and the beta-catenin cluster. However, there is still little overlap between most studies. Better study design and bio-informatical analysis might help in this context.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.04.027 	21612914

Author information:  (1)Mount Sinai Liver Cancer Program, Division of Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, New York, USA.  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous tumor that develops via activation of multiple pathways and molecular alterations. It has been a challenge to identify molecular classes of HCC and design treatment strategies for each specific subtype. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in HCC pathogenesis, and their expression profiles have been used to classify cancers. We analyzed miRNA expression in human HCC samples to identify molecular subclasses and oncogenic miRNAs. METHODS: We performed miRNA profiling of 89 HCC samples using a ligation-mediated amplification method. Subclasses were identified by unsupervised clustering analysis. We identified molecular features specific for each subclass using expression pattern (Affymetrix U133 2.0; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), DNA change (Affymetrix STY Mapping Array), mutation (CTNNB1), and immunohistochemical (phosphor[p]-protein kinase B, p-insulin growth factor-IR, p-S6, p-epidermal growth factor receptor, β-catenin) analyses. The roles of selected miRNAs were investigated in cell lines and in an orthotopic model of HCC. RESULTS: We identified 3 main clusters of HCCs: the wingless-type MMTV integration site (32 of 89; 36%), interferon-related (29 of 89; 33%), and proliferation (28 of 89; 31%) subclasses. A subset of patients with tumors in the proliferation subclass (8 of 89; 9%) overexpressed a family of poorly characterized miRNAs from chr19q13.42. Expression of miR-517a and miR-520c (from  ch19q13.42) increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. MiR-517a promoted tumorigenesis and metastatic dissemination in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: We propose miRNA-based classification of 3 subclasses of HCC. Among  the proliferation class, miR-517a is an oncogenic miRNA that promotes tumor progression. There is rationale for developing therapies that target miR-517a for patients with HCC.  Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Zeng C(1), Wang R, Li D, Lin XJ, Wei QK, Yuan Y, Wang Q, Chen W, Zhuang SM.  Author information:  (1)Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.  miR-122 is a highly abundant, hepatocyte-specific microRNA. The biomedical significance and regulatory mechanisms of miR-122 remain obscure. We explored the role of miR-122 in tumorigenesis in the context of gene regulatory network. The miR-122 promoter and its transactivator were identified by way of luciferase reporter system, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The miR-122 regulatory circuitry and its implication  in hepatocarcinogenesis were identified using livers of different development stages, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines, and aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁)-transformed cells. We characterized the -5.3 to -4.8 kb region upstream of miR-122 precursor as miR-122 promoter. Further investigation revealed that deletion of predicted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) binding sites C/EBPα knockdown significantly reduced miR-122 promoter activity and endogenous miR-122 expression; and C/EBPα directly interacted with the miR-122 promoter in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that C/EBPα is a transactivator for miR-122 transcription. We further demonstrated that miR-122 suppressed insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) translation and sustained glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) activity. The activated GSK-3β not only repressed cell proliferation, but also activated C/EBPα, which maintained miR-122 levels and thereby enforced IGF-1R suppression. Interestingly, down-regulation of miR-122 and C/EBPα, and up-regulation of IGF-1R were frequently observed in HCC tissues, and decreased miR-122 levels were associated  with worse survival of HCC patients. Moreover, AFB₁ exposure resulted in decreased activity in GSK-3β, C/EBPα, and miR-122 and increased levels of IGF-1R, whereas restoration of miR-122 suppressed the tumorigenicity of HCC and AFB₁-transformed cells.CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel GSK-3β-C/EBPα-miR-122-IGF-1R regulatory circuitry whose dysfunction may contribute to the development of HCC. Our findings provide new insight into miR-122's function and the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis.  DOI: 10.1002/hep.23875 	21038412

Bhattacharya SD(1), Garrison J, Guo H, Mi Z, Markovic J, Kim VM, Kuo PC.  Author information:  (1)Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.  BACKGROUND: Osteopontin (OPN) is a variably expressed, secreted glycophosphoprotein that mediates the growth and metastases of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may be responsible for variant OPN expression, interrupting translation by binding OPN messenger RNA (mRNA) in 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs). METHODS: A microarray analysis identified miRNAs of interest. Plasmid constructs  using a luciferase reporter with variable OPN 3'UTR mutations were transfected into 2 HCC cell lines to determine miRNA regulation of OPN expression. Western blot analyses confirmed variable OPN expression in both cell lines. Invasion, adhesion, and migration evaluated metastatic behavior in Hep G2 and Hep 3B with modified miRNA and OPN expression. RESULTS: Hep 3B produces 36 x miRNA 181a compared with Hep G2. Luciferase activity after transfection with miRNA 181a precursor was decreased in both cell  lines (P < .01); luciferase activity increased with miRNA 181a inhibitor transfection in both cell lines (P < .01). Hep 3B transfected with mutated OPN 3'UTR increased luciferase activity 108% (P < .01). Hep G2 transfected with miRNA precursor decreased OPN expression 5 x (P < .01) in Western blot analyses. Hep 3B transfection with miRNA precursor increased OPN expression 3 x (P < .01) in Western blot analyses. In vitro metastatic correlates increased in Hep 3B lines after transfection with siOPN and/or miRNA 181a inhibitor (P < .01). CONCLUSION: MiRNA 181a decreases OPN expression in HCC cell lines. This previously undescribed mechanism may confer metastatic characteristics to HCC.  Copyright 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.surg.2010.05.007  PMCID: PMC2905491	20576283

Comment in     Hepatology. 2010 Sep;52(3):1164-6.  Recurrent chromosomal aberrations are often observed in hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC), but little is known about the functional non-coding sequences, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), at the chromosomal breakpoints in HCC. Here we show that 22 miRNAs are often amplified or deleted in HCC. MicroRNA-151 (miR-151), a frequently amplified miRNA on 8q24.3, is correlated with intrahepatic metastasis of HCC. We further show that miR-151, which is often expressed together with its host gene FAK, encoding focal adhesion kinase, significantly increases HCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, mainly through miR-151-5p, but not through miR-151-3p. Moreover, miR-151 exerts this function by directly targeting RhoGDIA, a putative metastasis suppressor in  HCC, thus leading to the activation of Rac1, Cdc42 and Rho GTPases. In addition,  miR-151 can function synergistically with FAK to enhance HCC cell motility and spreading. Thus, our findings indicate that chromosome gain of miR-151 is a crucial stimulus for tumour invasion and metastasis of HCC.  DOI: 10.1038/ncb2039 	20305651

An insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (betaTrCP) is associated with susceptibility for hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese.  Chen S(1), He Y, Ding J, Jiang Y, Jia S, Xia W, Zhao J, Lu M, Gu Z, Gao Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Forensic Medicine, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123 Jiangsu, PR China.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an epithelial cancer which originates from hepatocytes or their progenitors. As a positive regulator of NFkappaB signaling pathway, beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (betaTrCP) is overexpressed and oncogenic in epithelial cancers, suggesting a potential role of betaTrCP in HCC susceptibility. We carried out a case-control study in a Chinese population (256 cases and 367 controls) to estimate the susceptibility to HCC associated with a 9bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs16405) in 3' untranslated region of betaTrCP. Using unconditional logistic regression, we found that 9N del/del and 9N ins/del genotypes were significantly associated with decreased HCC risk: OR=0.44 (0.24-0.83) (p=0.004) and OR=0.56 (0.31-1.00) (p=0.034), respectively. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that mRNA levels of betaTrCP from HCC tumor tissues were correlated with rs16405 genotypes. HCC tumor tissues with homozygous for 9N ins/ins has the highest level of betaTrCP, which are 3.99 and 7.04-fold higher than heterozygous 9N ins/del and homozygous 9N del/del, respectively. Based on bioinformatics prediction, we found that the risk allele for rs16405 disrupted a binding site for human microRNA-920 which would negatively regulate betaTrCP. We propose a microRNA-920 mediated betaTrCP regulation model depending on rs16405 genotype, which warrants further replication association studies and follow-up functional experiments.

An insertion/deletion polymorphism at miRNA-122-binding site in the interleukin-1alpha 3' untranslated region confers risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.  Gao Y(1), He Y, Ding J, Wu K, Hu B, Liu Y, Wu Y, Guo B, Shen Y, Landi D, Landi S, Zhou Y, Liu H.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Tumor Immunology, Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, People's Repubic of China.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy caused by environmental and genetic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs with posttranscriptional regulatory functions. They participate in diverse biological pathways and function as gene regulators. Genetic polymorphisms in 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) targeted by miRNAs alter the strength of miRNA binding, with consequences on regulation of target genes thereby affecting the individual's cancer risk. We have previously predicted polymorphisms falling in miRNA-binding regions of cancer genes. We selected an insertion/deletion (Indel) polymorphism (rs3783553) in the 3' UTR of interleukin  (IL)-1alpha (IL1A) for a case-control study in a Chinese population. With samples from 403 HCC patients and 434 healthy control individuals, strong evidence of association was observed for the variant homozygote. This association was validated in a second independent case-control study with 1074 HCC patients and 1239 healthy control individuals (odds ratio = 0.62; 95% confidence interval = 0.49-0.78). We further show that the 'TTCA' insertion allele for rs3783553 disrupts a binding site for miR-122 and miR-378, thereby increasing transcription of IL-1alpha in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that functional polymorphism rs3783553 in IL1A could contribute to HCC susceptibility. Considering IL-1alpha affects not only various phases of the malignant process, such as carcinogenesis, tumor growth and invasiveness, but also patterns of interactions between malignant cells and the host's immune system, our results indicated that IL-1alpha may be a promising target for immunotherapy, early diagnosis and intervention of HCC.

Yazici H(1), Zipprich J, Peng T, Akisik EZ, Tigli H, Isin M, Akisik EE, Terry MB, Senie RT, Li L, Peng M, Liu Z, Dalay N, Santella RM.  Author information:  (1)Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health,  Columbia University, NewYork, NY 10032, USA.  Background. MicroRNAs are a type of small noncoding RNA molecules that have been  shown to control gene expression in eukaryotes. Aberrant expression and alteration of miRNAs may be responsible for human diseases including cancer. An miR16-1 (C > T) + 7 gene mutation has been previously found in familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, one of which reported a family history of breast cancer. miR16-1 regulates the expression of bcl-2, which is important in retinoblastoma, and is located in a genomic region that is frequently lost in nasopharyngeal and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Therefore, miR16-1 may be potentially important in the etiology of several solid tumors. To understand the  power of the miR16-1 (C > T) + 7 mutation as a prognostic and diagnostic risk factor, we investigated the mutation in patients with seven different types of cancer including 188 with breast, 102 with ovarian, and 22 nasopharyngeal carcinomas, 96 HCC, 872 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 39 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 46 retinoblastoma cases from three different ethnic groups and of hereditary and sporadic etiology. Methods. 5'Nuclease TaqMan SNP genotyping assay was used to detect the miR16-1 gene C > T substitution. Results. The miR16-1 (C > T) + 7 substitution was not detected in any of the groups studied. Conclusions. Considering the large scale of our study, the representation of different ethnicities and levels of hereditary risk, we conclude that the miR-16-1 (C > T) + 7 mutation is not a good diagnostic or prognostic indicator of risk for the cancers tested.

Author information:  (1)National Human Genome Research Center at Shanghai-Ministry of Science and Technology to build a healthy and disease Genomics Laboratory, Shanghai, 201203,  China. huangj@chgc.sh.cn  Hepatocellular carcinoma is the main type of primary liver cancer, and also one of the most malignant tumors. At present, the pathogenesis mechanisms of liver cancer are not entirely clear. It has been shown that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes play a significant role in carcinogenesis, caused by the genetic and epigenetic aberrance. In the past, people generally thought that genetic mutation is a key event of tumor pathogenesis, and somatic mutation of tumor suppressor genes is in particular closely associated with oncogenesis. With deeper understanding of tumors in recent years, increasing evidence has shown that epigenetic silencing of those genes, as a result of aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters and histone modification, is essential to carcinogenesis and metastasis. The term epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression caused by regulation mechanisms, other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. Specific epigenetic processes include DNA methylation, genome imprinting, chromotin remodeling, histone modification and microRNA regulations. This paper reviews recent epigenetics research progress in the hepatocellular carcinoma study, and tries to depict the relationships between hepatocellular carcinomagenesis and DNA methylation as well as microRNA regulation.

Author information:  (1)Center for Genomic Medicine, Kyoto University, Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Kyoto, Japan. ymurakami@genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp  Comment in     J Hepatol. 2009 Mar;50(3):441-4.  BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current anti-HCV therapies are based on interferon therapy, which is insufficiently effective. microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, and they have recently been shown to play an  important role in viral replication. METHODS: An algorithm-based search for miRNAs that target the HCV genome yielded  one miRNA, miR-199a, with a sequence similar to the HCV genome that is conserved  among HCV genotypes. RESULTS: Over expression of miR-199a inhibited HCV genome replication in two cells bearing replicons (replicon cell) HCV-1b or -2a, however, miRNA inhibition  by specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) accelerated viral replication. Prior  transfection of immortalized hepatocytes which were infected with serum of HCV genotype 1b and 2a-infected patients, with miR-199a reduced HCV RNA replication activity. Mutation in the miR-199a target site in the replicon reduced the effect of the miR-199a. HCV replicon RNA is accumulated to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) when miR-199a was over-expressed to the replicon cell. This antiviral effect by miR-199a was independent of the interferon pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that miR-199a directly regulates HCV replication and may serve as a novel antiviral therapy.  DOI: 10.1016/j.jhep.2008.06.010 	19144437

Author information:  (1)TNLIST/Department of Automation, Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics Division, MOE Key Laboratory, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly malignancies worldwide.  Scientists have been studying the molecular mechanism of HCC for years, but the understanding of it remains incomplete and scattered across the literature at different molecular levels. Chromosomal aberrations, epigenetic abnormality and changes of gene expression have been reported in HCC. High-throughput omics technologies have been widely applied, aiming at the discovery of candidate biomarkers for cancer staging, prediction of recurrence and prognosis, and treatment selection. Large amounts of data on genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, gene expression profiles, microRNA expression profiles and proteomics have been accumulating, and bioinformatics is playing a more and more  important role. In this paper, we review the current omics-based studies on HCC at the levels of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. Integrating observations from multiple aspects is an essential step toward the systematic understanding of the disease.  DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmn001 	19129945

Comment in     Hepatology. 2008 Jun;47(6):1807-9.  Molecular classifications defining new tumor subtypes have been recently refined  with genetic and transcriptomic analyses of benign and malignant hepatocellular tumors. Here, we performed microRNA (miRNA) profiling in two series of fully annotated liver tumors to uncover associations between oncogene/tumor suppressor  mutations and clinical and pathological features. Expression levels of 250 miRNAs in 46 benign and malignant hepatocellular tumors were compared to those of 4 normal liver samples with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. miRNAs associated with genetic and clinical characteristics were validated in a second series of 43 liver tumor samples and 16 nontumor samples. miRNA profiling unsupervised analysis classified samples in unique clusters characterized by histological features (tumor/nontumor, P < 0.001; benign/malignant tumors, P < 0.01; inflammatory adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia, P < 0.01), clinical characteristics [hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, P < 0.001; alcohol consumption, P < 0.05], and oncogene/tumor suppressor gene mutations [beta-catenin, P < 0.01; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha), P < 0.01]. Our study identified and validated miR-224 overexpression in all tumors and miR-200c, miR-200, miR-21, miR-224, miR-10b, and miR-222 specific deregulation in benign or malignant tumors. Moreover, miR-96 was overexpressed in HBV tumors, and miR-126* was down-regulated in alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Down-regulations of miR-107 and miR-375 were specifically associated with HNF1alpha and beta-catenin gene mutations, respectively. miR-375 expression was highly correlated to that of beta-catenin-targeted genes as miR-107 expression was correlated to that of HNF1alpha in a small interfering RNA cell line model. Thus, this strongly suggests that beta-catenin and HNF1alpha could regulate miR-375 and miR-107 expression levels, respectively.CONCLUSION: Hepatocellular tumors may have a distinct miRNA expression fingerprint according to malignancy, risk factors, and  oncogene/tumor suppressor gene alterations. Dissecting these relationships provides a new hypothesis to understand the functional impact of miRNA deregulation in liver tumorigenesis and the promising use of miRNAs as diagnostic markers.

Yang J(1), Zhou F, Xu T, Deng H, Ge YY, Zhang C, Li J, Zhuang SM.  Author information:  (1)Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, PR China.  It is well demonstrated that mutations in protein-coding genes play a key role during carcinogenesis. Whether sequence variations in microRNA genes are also associated with tumorigenesis is still unknown and thus require extensive investigations. In the present study, genomic sequences coding for the precursors of 59 microRNA genes were analyzed in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and liver cancer derived cell lines. In total, four variations in three microRNAs, including miR-106b, miR-192 and let-7a-2, were found in four out of 96 HCC tissues. Further investigation in the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues identified the same sequence variations, suggesting the possibility of germline mutations or natural polymorphisms. Moreover, no variation was found in  eight liver cancer derived cell lines. Among four sequence alterations observed in this study, two were located in miR-106b and identified as known single nucleotide polymorphisms, while the other two found in miR-192 and let-7a-2 had not been reported before. In conclusion, our data suggest that mutation of microRNA is a rare event in HCC and thus may not represent a main mechanism underlying hepatocarcinogenesis.

Author information:  (1)Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Box 8007, 660 South Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.  Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are promising gene therapy vectors that have little or no acute toxicity. We show that normal mice and mice with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after  neonatal injection of an AAV vector expressing b-glucuronidase. AAV proviruses were isolated from four tumors and were all located within a 6-kilobase region of chromosome 12. This locus encodes several imprinted transcripts, small nucleolar  RNAs (snoRNAs), and microRNAs. Transcripts from adjacent genes encoding snoRNAs and microRNAs were overexpressed in tumors. Our findings implicate this locus in  the development of HCC and raise concerns over the clinical use of AAV vectors.  DOI: 10.1126/science.1142658 	17656716
