MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that can function as gene regulators
and are involved in tumorigenesis. We review the commonly dysregulated miRNAs in 
liver tumor tissues and plasma/serum of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The frequently reported up-regulated
miRNAs in liver tumor tissues include miR-18a, miR-21, miR-221, miR-222, and
miR-224, whereas down-regulated miRNAs include miR-26a, miR-101, miR-122,
miR-125b, miR-145, miR-199a, miR-199b, miR-200a, and miR-223. For a subset of
these miRNAs (up-regulated miR-222 and miR-224, down-regulated miR-26a and
miR-125b), the pattern of dysregulated circulating miRNAs in plasma/serum is
mirrored in tumor tissue based on multiple independent studies. Dysregulated
miRNAs target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes involved in
hepatocarcinogenesis. Normalization of dysregulated miRNAs by up- or
down-regulation has been shown to inhibit HCC cell proliferation or sensitize
liver cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatment. miRNAs hold as yet unrealized
potential as biomarkers for early detection of HCC and as precision therapeutic
targets, but further studies in diverse populations and across all stages of HCC 
are needed.

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) has been identified as a biomarker of liver
diseases. However, the miR-122 detection accuracy in patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is inconclusive.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of Web of Science, Cochrane 
Library, PubMed, and Embase to identify studies related to the diagnostic value
of miR-122 in HCV-related HCC. We analyzed the results and validated them using
data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
RESULTS: Six articles were included in this meta-analysis, comprising 354 cases
and 420 controls. The pooled specificity, sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio,
negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve were
0.87, 0.83, 5.1, 0.16, 32, and 0.92, respectively. Additional sub-group analyses 
showed that results for plasma were more sensitive than those for serum. In
addition, miR-122 was better at distinguishing between HCV-associated HCC and
healthy people or those with HCV than between those with HCV-associated HCC and
HCV-related cirrhosis. Small samples (≤100) had better diagnostic odds ratios
than larger samples (>100). Analysis of data from TCGA confirmed that miRNA-122
had a high diagnostic value.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that miR-122 may be a useful
diagnostic biomarker for HCV-associated HCC.

The unique character of selenium compounds, including sodium selenite and
Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC), is that they exert cytotoxic effects on neoplastic
cells, providing a great potential for treating cancer cells being highly
resistant to cytostatic drugs. However, selenium treatment may affect microRNA
(miRNA) expression as the pattern of circulating miRNAs changed in a
placebo-controlled selenium supplement study. This necessitates exploring
possible changes in the expression profiles of miRNAs. For this, miRNAs being
critical for liver function were selected and their expression was measured in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HLE and HLF) and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (TFK-1
and HuH-28) using individual TaqMan MicroRNA Assays following selenite or MSC
treatments. For establishing tolerable concentrations, IC50 values were
determined by performing SRB proliferation assays. The results revealed much
lower IC50 values for selenite (from 2.7 to 11.3 μM) compared to MSC (from 79.5
to 322.6 μM). The treatments resulted in cell line-dependent miRNA expression
patterns, with all miRNAs found to show fold change differences; however, only a 
few of these changes were statistically different in treated cells compared to
untreated cells below IC50. Namely, miR-199a in HLF, miR-143 in TFK-1 upon MSC
treatment, miR-210 in HLF and TFK-1, miR-22, -24, -122, -143 in HLF upon selenite
treatment. Fold change differences revealed that miR-122 with both selenium
compounds, miR-199a with MSC and miR-22 with selenite were affected. The miRNAs
showing minimal alterations included miR-125b and miR-194. In conclusion, our
results revealed moderately altered miRNA expression in the cell lines (less
alterations following MSC treatment), being miR-122, -199a the most affected and 
miR-125b, -194 the least altered miRNAs upon selenium treatment.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) has been identified as a marker of various liver injuries,
including hepatitis- virus-infection-, alcoholic-, and non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced liver fibrosis. Here, we report that the
extracellular miR-122 from hepatic cells can be delivered to hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs) to modulate their proliferation and gene expression. Our published
Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (Ago-CLIP) data identified several
pro-fibrotic genes, including Ctgf, as miR-122 targets in mice livers. However,
treating Ctgf as a therapeutic target failed to rescue the fibrosis developed in 
the miR-122 knockout livers. Alternatively, we compared the published datasets of
human cirrhotic livers and miR-122 KO livers, which revealed upregulation of
BCL2, suggesting its potential role in regulating fibrosis. Notably, ectopic
miR-122 expression inhibited BCL2 expression in human HSC (LX-2) cells). Publicly
available ChIP-seq data in human hepatocellular cancer (HepG2) cells and mice
livers suggested miR-122 could regulate BCL2 expression indirectly through c-MYC,
which was confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of c-MYC in Hepatocellular
Carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Importantly, Venetoclax, a potent BCL2 inhibitor
approved for the treatment of leukemia, showed promising anti-fibrotic effects in
miR-122 knockout mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that miR-122 suppresses
liver fibrosis and implicates anti-fibrotic potential of Venetoclax.

Role of Extracellular Vesicles in the Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Tracking of 
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.

Australia.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver
disease, affecting approximately one-third of the global population. Most
affected individuals experience only simple steatosis-an accumulation of fat in
the liver-but a proportion of these patients will progress to the more severe
form of the disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which enhances the
risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnostic approaches to NAFLD
are currently limited in accuracy and efficiency; and liver biopsy remains the
only reliable way to confirm NASH. This technique, however, is highly invasive
and poses risks to patients. Hence, there is an increasing demand for improved
minimally invasive diagnostic tools for screening at-risk individuals and
identifying patients with more severe disease as well as those likely to progress
to such stages. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs)-small membrane-bound
particles released by virtually all cell types into circulation-have emerged as a
rich potential source of biomarkers that can reflect liver function and
pathological processes in NAFLD. Of particular interest to the diagnosis and
tracking of NAFLD is the potential to extract microRNAs miR-122 and miR-192 from 
EVs circulating in blood, particularly when using an isolation technique that
selectively captures hepatocyte-derived EVs.

Dedifferentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma: molecular mechanisms and
therapeutic implications.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with high morbidity and
mortality. Poorer differentiation status indicates worse prognosis of HCC
patients. Regain of better differentiation status may improve the prognosis.
Differentiation therapy for HCC is based on the fact that agents may reverse the 
dedifferentiation process from hepatocytes to HCC cells and thus improve tumor
differentiation status. Reversal of progenitor-like property and restoration of
hepatic characteristics are main objectives of HCC differentiation therapy.
Comprehending the mechanisms of HCC dedifferentiation provides ideas for drug
design. Diverse dysregulated molecules and signalings cooperatively cause HCC
dedifferentiation. Dysregulation of liver enriched transcription factors,
especially hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, was a critical determinant of HCC
dedifferentiation. Aberrant pivotal signaling molecules such as transforming
factor-β, β-catenin and Yes-associated protein caused disordered signalings,
which promoted HCC dedifferentiation. Loss of epithelial morphology during
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) concurred with HCC dedifferentiation.
Some EMT-related molecules exerted double-sided role in concurrently inducing EMT
and HCC dedifferentiation. Besides, microRNAs (e.g. miR-122 and miR-148a) as well
as some impressive proteins (i.e. KLF4, gankyrin and CHD1L) functioned in
manipulating HCC differentiation status. Restoring normal expression levels of
these molecules could induce HCC differentiation and inhibited malignant tumor
behaviors. Based on the knowledge above, some agents have been found effective in
lab, but need more data to support their reliability. Additionally, peretinoin as
a potential drug is in progress of several phase III clinical trials. It's
promising that differentiation therapy for HCC may be a part of options in future
HCC treatment.

Telomerase reverse-transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in circulating
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as well as the levels of circulating microRNA-122 (miR-122)
have been reported as potential noninvasive biomarkers for several. This study
evaluates the diagnostic performance of potent biomarker-based panels composing
of serological AFP, miR-122 and circulating TERT promoter mutations for screening
HBV-related HCC. TERT promoter mutations (C228T and C250T) and miR-122 expression
were assessed in the plasma samples from 249 patients with HBV-related liver
diseases by nested PCR and qRT-PCR assays, respectively. The diagnostic values of
TERT promoter mutations, miR-122 expression and biomarker-based panels were
assessed by computation of the area under the curve (AUC). Nested-PCR assays were
optimized to detect C228T and C250T mutations in TERT promoter with detection
limit of 1%. The common hotspot C228T was observed in 22 HCC cases. The triple
combinatory panel (AFP@TERT@miR-122) acquired the best diagnostic value to
distinguish HCC from CHB (AUC = 0.98), LC (AUC = 0.88) or non-HCC (LC + CHB,
AUC = 0.94) compared to the performance of double combinations or single
biomarkers, respectively. Notably, among patients with AFP levels≤20 ng/μl, the
double combination panel (TERT@miR-122) retains satisfactory diagnostic
performance in discriminating HCC from the others (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.96; HCC
vs. LC, AUC = 0.88, HCC vs. non-HCC, AUC = 0.94). The triple combination panel
AFP@TERT@miR-122 shows a better diagnostic performance for screening HCC in HBV
patients, regardless of AFP levels. The newly established panels can be a
potential application in clinical practice in Vietnamese setting.

BACKGROUND: In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), abnormal expression of multiple
microRNAs (miRNAs) has been shown to be involved in the malignant biological
behavior of liver cancer. The vast majority of liver cancer cases in China are
closely related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but there are few studies
on the changes of miRNA expression in the progression from HBV infection to
hepatoma.
AIM: To explore the role of miRNAs in the progression of HBV infection to
cirrhosis and even to liver cancer.
METHODS: We screened differentially expressed miRNAs in 40 HBV cirrhosis, 40
normal and 15 HCC tissues by using a TaqMan Low Density Array and real time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. To evaluate the power of the selected
miRNAs to predict disease, we calculated the area under the
receiver-operating-characteristic curves. The overall survival of HBV cirrhosis
patients was analyzed via Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: The levels of miR-375, miR-122 and miR-143 were significantly lower in
HBV cirrhosis tissues, while miR-224 was significantly higher than in the
controls (P < 0.0001). The area under the curves of the
receiver-operating-characteristic curve for the 4-miRNA panel was 0.991 (95%CI:
0.974-1). Patients with a lower expression level of miR-224 or higher expression 
levels of miR-375, miR-122 and miR-143 had longer overall survival.
CONCLUSION: The four miRNAs (miR-375, miR-122, miR-143 and miR-224) may be
helpful for early diagnosis of HBV infection, HBV cirrhosis, and prediction of
its overall survival.

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
progression and metastasis. However, it is unclear whether they could act as
biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis.
METHODS: In this study, the miR-122 and miR-199a expression levels were
determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The function and molecular
mechanism of miR-122 and miR-199a target genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Correlation
between miRNA expression levels and the overall survival (OS) of HCC patients was
assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Serum miR-122 expression had no significant difference between patients 
with HCC (HCC patients) and healthy controls (HCs), whereas serum miR-199a
expression was significantly lower in HCC patients than the HCs (p<0.05).
Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that miR-199a
could be an effective diagnostic biomarker for HCC, which was confirmed by
obvious expression polarization patterns of miR-199a target genes. Kaplan-Meier
analysis revealed that miR-122 expression level was associated with the OS of HCC
patients (p<0.001), suggesting that miR-122 could be a prognostic biomarker for
HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results showed that circulating miR-199a and
miR-122 levels could serve as novel, non-invasive biomarkers for HCC diagnosis
and prognosis, respectively.

Background: Circulating microRNA-122 (miR-122) has been recognized as a marker of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current meta-analysis was performed to
quantitatively evaluate the diagnostic performance of circulating miR-122 for
HCC.
Methods: Related studies that evaluated the diagnostic performance of circulating
miR-122 determined from pathophysiological examination for HCC were obtained by
systematic searches of the PubMed and Embase databases. A randomized fixed
effects model was applied according to the heterogeneity among studies. The
pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.
Publication bias was detected by Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test.
Results: Thirteen studies providing data for 920 HCC patients and 1217 controls
were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivities, specificities, and 
AUCs of serum miR-122 were 0.76, 0.75, and 0.82, respectively, for discriminating
HCC patients from overall controls; 0.85, 0.83, and 0.91, respectively, for
discriminating HCC patients from healthy controls; 0.79, 0.82, and 0.87,
respectively, for discriminating HCC from HBV or HCV infection; and 0.65, 0.75,
and 0.74, respectively, for discriminating HCC from liver cirrhosis or dysplastic
nodule formation. No significant publication bias was detected.
Conclusions: Serum miR-122 confers moderate efficacy for discriminating HCC
patients from healthy controls or patients with HBV or HCV infection, but not for
discriminating HCC patients from those with liver cirrhosis or dysplastic nodule 
formation.

Growing evidence has illustrated critical roles of competing endogenous RNA
(ceRNA) regulatory network in human cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma.
In this study, we aimed to find promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Three novel unfavorable
prognosis-associated genes (CELSR3, GPSM2, and CHEK1) was first identified. We
also demonstrated that these genes were significantly upregulated in
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and tissues. Next, 154 potential miRNAs of
CELSR3, GPSM2, and CHEK1 were predicted. CHEK1-hsa-mir-195-5p/hsa-mir-497-5p and 
GPSM2-hsa-mir-122-5p axes were defined as two key pathways in carcinogenesis of
hepatocellular carcinoma by combination of in silico analysis and experimental
validation. Subsequently, lncRNAs binding to hsa-mir-195-5p, hsa-mir-497-5p, and 
hsa-mir-122-5p were predicted via starBase and miRNet databases. After performing
expression analysis and survival analysis for these predicted lncRNAs, we showed 
that nine lncRNAs (SNHG1, SNHG12, LINC00511, HCG18, FGD5-AS1, CERS6-AS1,
NUTM2A-AS1, SNHG16, and ASB16-AS1) were markedly increased in hepatocellular
carcinoma and their upregulation indicated poor prognosis. Moreover, a similar
mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA analysis for six "known" genes (CLEC3B, DNASE1L3, PTTG1, KIF2C,
XPO5, and UBE2S) was performed. Subsequently, a comprehensive mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA
triple ceRNA network linked to prognosis of patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma was established. Moreover, all RNAs in this network exhibited
significantly diagnostic values for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In
summary, the current study constructed a mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA ceRNA network
associated with diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human cancers, its
prevalence and severity need us to discover novel early diagnostic biomarkers and
new therapeutic strategies. MicroRNA-122 is the most abundant microRNA in the
liver, and acts as a tumor suppressor and represses HCC development. In our study
we showed that HNF-4α and MiR-122 were down-regulated significantly in
hepatocellular carcinoma. Over-expression of HNF-4α inhibit hepatocellular
carcinoma cells proliferation. And miR-122 is one of the downstream effector of
HNF-4α. Up-regulated miR-122 inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cells
proliferation through regulating ADAM17. Collectively, our results suggested that
HNF-4α could inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation with miR-122 being a 
downstream target of it. And miR-122 would inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma
proliferation by regulating ADAM17 signal pathway.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and
associated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. At present, there
is no prophylactic vaccine against HCV due to the lack of in vivo and in vitro
model systems. Although most recombinants of all major HCV genotypes replicate in
Huh-7 cell line and derivatives, these cells are human hepatoma-derived cell
line. Therefore, the development of un-tumor-derived cell systems facilitating
the entire HCV life cycle is urgently needed. In this study, we aimed to
establish a novel tree shrew-derived bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell
(BM-MSC) system to reconstruct the HCV life cycle. We transduction cluster of
differentiation 81 (CD81), occludin (OCLN), and microRNA-122 (miR-122) into
BM-MSCs, then used a well-established HCV, produced from the J6/JFH1-Huh7.5.1
culture system, to infect the cells. We observed that BM-MSCs transduction with
CD81/OCLN or CD81/OCLN/miR-122 support HCV RNA replication and infectious virus
production. We also found that the addition of exogenous vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) can enhance HCV infectivity in BM-MSCs, with HCV virus load 
up to 105 copies/mL. In conclusion, we identified the minimum essential factors
required for HCV replication in tree shrew-derived nonhuman nonhepatic BM-MSCs.
Further, we identified that exogenous addition of VEGF, and exogenous expression 
of CD81, OCLN, and miR-122, facilitates efficient viral replication and
production of infectious particles. Our results describe a novel cell system
capable of supporting the entire HCV life cycle, which may provide an essential
tool for anti-HCV drug discovery, vaccine development, and study of pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: There is ongoing search for new noninvasive biomarkers to improve
management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies, mostly from 
the Asian-Pacific region, demonstrated differential expression of liver-specific 
microRNA-122 (miR-122) in tissue as well as in sera of patients with hepatitis B 
virus- and hepatitis C virus-induced HCC.
AIM: To evaluate prognostic value of miR-122 in patients with HCC in a European
population and determine potential factors related to alteration of miR-122 in
sera.
METHODS: Patients with confirmed HCC (n = 91) were included in the study over a
two-year period. Patients were characterized according to Child-Pugh score,
Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging system, etiology of liver disease,
laboratory parameters and overall survival. MiR-122 was measured in sera using
TaqMan assay normalized to spiked-in cel-miR-39.
RESULTS: Serum miR-122 quantity was independent of the Child-Pugh score, the BCLC
stage or the underlying etiology. Significant positive correlation was found
between miR-122 and alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.0001), aspartate
aminotransferase (P = 0.0001), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (P = 0.0034) and
hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.076). Negative correlation was observed between
miR-122 level and creatinine concentration (P = 0.0028). AFP, Child-Pugh score
and BCLC staging system were associated with survival differences. In overall
cohort low miR-122 in sera was only associated with a trend for a better overall 
survival without reaching statistical significance. Subgroup analysis revealed
that low miR-122 was significantly associated with better prognosis in patients
with advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B/C), advanced tumor stage (BCLC B/C/D)
and normal AFP (< 7 ng/mL).
CONCLUSION: Our results strongly support the value of miR-122 as potential
biomarker of liver injury and probably prognosis. Nevertheless, the value of
miR-122 in prediction of prognosis of HCC patients was limited to certain
patients' subgroups. Since circulating miR-122 may be influenced by impaired
renal function, AFP and hemoglobin concentration, those factors need to be
considered while interpreting miR-122 level.

Ultrasound-induced microbubble sonoporation has been shown to effectively improve
drug/gene delivery efficiency by enhancing tissue and cell permeability. However,
the microscale size and short duration of ultrasound contrast agents limit their 
accumulation in target areas. Here, a kind of ultrasound-triggered
phase-transitioning and size-changing cationic nanodroplet,
perfluoropentane/C9F17-PAsp(DET)/miR-122/poly(glutamic acid)-g-MeO-poly(ethylene 
glycol) (PGA-g-mPEG) ternary nanodroplets (PFP-TNDs/miR-122), was developed to
deliver microRNA-122 (miR-122) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. PFP 
served as an ultrasound-sensitive core for ultrasound-triggered phase transition 
and size change from the nanoscale to the microscale. Positively charged
C9F17-PAsp(DET) ensured adequate miRNA loading. PGA-g-mPEG, which served as the
shell of the nanodroplet, modified the nanodroplets, enhanced their stability in 
serum, and protected miR-122 from degradation in vivo. The results exhibited that
PFP-TNDs/miR-122 has a nanosize diameter (362 ± 15 nm) and remained stable for 24
h. After treatment with PFP-TNDs/miR-122 combined with ultrasound irradiation,
the miR-122 expression level was significantly increased by approximately
600-fold in HepG2 cells, 500-fold in SMMC-7721 cells, and 30-fold in human HCC
xenografts. Moreover, PFP-TNDs/miR-122 combined with ultrasound radiation
effectively suppressed the growth, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, and
inhibited tumor proliferation in mice. This study revealed that the biodegradable
PFP-TNDs is a promising therapeutic gene carrier with functions of gene
protection and effective gene delivery for clinical applications. Furthermore,
PFP-TNDs/miR-122 associated with ultrasound irradiation may pave a new way to
improve the prognosis of patients with HCC.

Hepatic steatosis is the hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance with
potential evolution towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. Key roles of autophagy and oxidative stress in hepatic 
lipid accumulation and NAFLD progression are recognized. Here, we employed a rat 
hepatoma cell model of NAFLD progression made of FaO cells exposed to
oleate/palmitate followed or not by TNFα treatment to investigate the molecular
mechanisms through which silybin, a lipid-lowering nutraceutical, may improve
hepatic lipid dyshomeostasis. The beneficial effect of silybin was found to
involve amelioration of the fatty acids profile of lipid droplets, stimulation of
the mitochondrial oxidation and upregulation of a microRNA of pivotal relevance
in hepatic fat metabolism, miR-122. Silybin was also found to restore the levels 
of Aquaporin-9 (AQP9) and glycerol permeability while reducing the activation of 
the oxidative stress-dependent transcription factor NF-κB, and autophagy
turnover. In conclusion, silybin was shown to have molecular effects on signaling
pathways that were previously unknown and potentially protect the hepatocyte.
These actions intersect TG metabolism, fat-induced autophagy and AQP9-mediated
glycerol transport in hepatocytes.

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related cirrhosis is one of the liver
complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and reported to be a risk factor
for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A reliable screening biomarker of 
liver cirrhosis (LC) and HCC among T2DM patients is important to reduce the
morbidity and mortality of this disease. MicroRNA (miRNA) is considered a key
player in HCC and T2DM, and it might be a hidden culprit in diabetes-associated
HCC, making it a promising reliable prognostic tool.
AIM: To investigate the signature of serum miRNAs as early biomarkers for the
screening of HCC among diabetic patients.
METHODS: Expression profiles of miRNAs in serum samples of diabetic LC and
diabetic HCC patients were assessed using Illumina sequencing; then, RT-qPCR was 
used to validate significantly altered miRNAs between the two groups. Candidate
miRNAs were tested in serum samples of 200 T2DM patients, 270 LC patients, 200
HCC patients, and 225 healthy control subjects. Additionally, receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis, with area under the curve (AUC), was performed to 
assess the diagnostic performance of the screened miRNAs for discriminating HCC
from LC and nonmalignant patients (LC + T2DM).
RESULTS: Expression of the sequenced miRNAs in serum was different in HCC vs
LC-positive T2DM patients. Two miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-221) were significantly
up-regulated and five miRNAs (miR-16, miR-23-3p, miR-122-5p, miR-198,
miR-199a-3p) were significantly down-regulated in HCC compared to LC patients.
Analysis of ROC curve demonstrated that the combination of these seven miRNAs can
be used as a reliable biomarker for detection of HCC in diabetic patients, as it 
could identify HCC with high diagnostic accuracy in diabetic LC patients (AUC =
0.993) and in diabetic nonmalignant patients (AUC = 0.961).
CONCLUSION: This study validates a panel of serum miRNAs that can be used as a
reliable noninvasive screening biomarker of HCC among T2DM cirrhotic and
noncirrhotic patients. The study recommends further research to shed light on a
possible role of c-Met in T2DM-associated HCC via the miRNA regulatory pathway.

Introduction: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection persists in most infected
individuals and can lead to the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a crucial role in various
liver diseases, especially HCC. The expression profiles of circulating microRNAs 
have been studied aiming at the identification of novel non-invasive biomarkers. 
This study aims to develop a non-invasive diagnostic tool based on measuring the 
serum levels of different miRNAs in order to detect HCV-induced HCC at the early 
stages of the disease.
Material and methods: Five main miRNAs (miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139,
miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a) were selected according to the literature that
demonstrated their unique expression pattern during HCC development. Serum
samples were collected from 42 cases of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) without
cirrhosis, 45 cases of CHC with cirrhosis (LC), 38 cases of HCC with HCV, and 40 
healthy individuals serving as a control. The five miRNAs were measured using
real-time reverse transcription PCR. The conventional HCC markers α-fetoprotein
(AFP) and des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) were measured with commercial kits.
Results: Serum levels of miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and
miRNA-199a were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in HCC than in CHC and LC groups. 
As a single marker, miRNA-122a had the highest sensitivity for HCC, followed by
miRNA-199a, miRNA-145, miRNA-139, and miRNA-125a.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that measurement of serum levels of
miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a can differentiate
HCC from CHC and LC. Our results suggest that serum miR-122 might serve as a
novel and potential noninvasive biomarker for HCV-induced HCC.

Although microRNAs (miRNAs) function as the important tumor gene regulators, they
still confront with many challenges in systemic delivery. Here, the amphiphilic
gemcitabine-oleic acid prodrugs (GOA) binding miRNAs with hydrogen bond are
assembled into nanoparticles (GOA/miR NPs) through hydrophobic interaction via
denaturation-annealing processes and nano-precipitation technique. The
non-cationic GOA/miR NPs with an average size of ~150 nm and a zeta potential of 
~ - 15 mV exhibit a stable encapsulation of miRNAs with non-sequence selectivity.
Either miR-122 or miR-34a encapsulated in the GOA/miR NPs is efficiently
delivered into HepG2 cells and significantly downregulate the expression levels
of target gene after lysosome escape and pH-responsive disassembly. Moreover, in 
vivo experiments demonstrate that the GOA/miR-122 NPs exhibit higher tumor
accumulation. Compared to GOA micelles, GOA/miR-122 NPs displayed stronger tumor 
inhibition (73% regression) after intravenous injection in nude mice xenografted 
with HCC, along with rapid clearance in normal liver tissues. Furthermore, there 
is no significant influence on biochemical indicators and immune factors during
the systematic administration of GOA/miR-122 NPs. The non-cationic GOA/miR NPs
engineered by hydrogen bond interaction and hydrophobic forces show the enhanced 
synergistic antitumor efficacy and good biosafety, which will provide a potential
nanomedcine for HCC treatment.

BACKGROUND: The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a promising prognostic and
diagnostic tool in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we performed small RNA
sequencing (sRNA-seq) of tissue, serum and serum exosomes to investigate changes 
in miRNA expression between the different sample types and correlated the
expression with clinical parameters. We also performed gene expression arrays on 
tumor and normal tissue.
RESULTS: Paired tissue, serum and serum exosomes sequencing revealed consistent
positive correlation of miR-21 between serum exosomes and tumor tissue,
indicating that miR-21 could be exported from tissue to circulation via exosomes.
We found that let-7 miRNAs are generally upregulated in serum exosomes compared
to whole serum, indicating that these miRNAs could be preferentially loaded into 
exosomes. Comparing serum from HCC patients with serum from healthy individuals
revealed a global increase of miRNAs in serum from HCC patients, including an
almost 4-fold increase of several miRNAs, including the liver-specific miR-122.
When correlating miRNA expression with clinical parameters we detected
significant association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and miR-122 in 
serum as well as several serum and tissue-miRNAs that correlated with surgery
type. We found that miR-141 and miR-146 correlated with cirrhosis in tumor tissue
and normal tissue, respectively. Finally, high expression of miR-21 in tumors
were associated with poor survival. Focusing on gene expression we found several 
significant messenger RNAs (mRNAs) between tumor and normal tissue and a Gene
Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these changes were mainly related to cell
cycle and metabolism. Further, we detected mRNAs that correlated with cirrhosis
and HBV infection in tissue. Finally, GO analysis of predicted targets for miRNAs
down-regulated in tumor found that these were enriched for functions related to
collagen synthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our combined data point to altered miRNA and mRNA expression
contributing to both generally impaired lipid metabolism and increased cell
proliferation and a miRNA-driven increase in collagen synthesis in HCC. Our
results further indicate a correlation in miRNA expression between exosomes,
serum, and tissue samples suggesting export from tumors via exosomes. This
correlation could provide a basis for a more tumor-specific miRNA profile in
serum.

BACKGROUND: The identification of high-sensitivity biomarkers for detection of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from high-risk individuals is essential.
OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to identify and validate serum
microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related
HCC.
METHODS: Illumina sequencing was employed to screen the expression profiles of
miRNAs in serum samples of HCV-related HCC patients and liver cirrhosis (LC)
patients. RT-qPCR was used to confirm the altered miRNAs between the two groups. 
Moreover, candidate miRNAs were examined in serum samples of 40 HCC patients, 54 
LC patients, 55 patients with chronic HCV hepatitis and 45 healthy controls.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the
diagnostic performance of the miRNAs for the detection of HCC.
RESULTS: Four miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-331-3p, miR-494-3p, miR-224-5p) were
significantly increased and two miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-23b-3p) were
significantly decreased in HCC patients compared to LC patients. ROC curve
analysis demonstrated that the six miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers
for HCC detection. Combination of the six miRNAs could efficiently detect HCC in 
LC patients with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.995 and combination of
the six miRNAs also provided high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.961) for detection
of HCC in non-HCC subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The six serum miRNAs can be utilized as a surrogate and non-invasive
biomarker for HCV-related HCC diagnosis.

Downregulation of MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) and its association with cancer
progression have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line models
and a limited number of HCC samples. Recently, restoration of miR-122 expression 
by direct delivery of miR-122 yielded promising results in HCCs. However, the
prognostic effect of miR-122 expression in human HCC samples is not fully
understood. We investigated the expression level of miR-122 by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction in 289 curatively resected HCC samples and 20
normal liver samples and evaluated the prognostic effect of miR-122 expression.
The relative quantification value of miR-122 was much lower in HCC samples than
in normal liver tissues. During a median 119 months of follow-up for survival,
the low miR-122 expression group showed shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS)
(p = 0.033) and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (IHRFS) (p = 0.014), and a 
trend of short distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (p = 0.149) than high
expression group. On multivariate analysis, miR-122 expression was an independent
prognostic factor for RFS, IHRFS and DMFS. Downregulation of miR-122 expression, 
frequently found in HCC samples, was an independent prognostic factor for RFS
after curative resection. Emerging therapeutic approaches targeting miR-122 could
be applicable in patients with miR-122 downregulated hepatocellular carcinoma.

We previously showed that miR-122 was frequently downregulated in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) and C/EBPα transactivated miR-122 expression. In this study, we
found that Sp1 bound to the miR-122 promoter at two different sites.
Interestingly, either inhibition or overexpression of Sp1 could decrease the
miR-122 promoter activity and the cellular miR-122 level in hepatoma cells.
Further investigations disclosed that Sp1 cooperated with C/EBPα to induce
miR-122 transcription by binding to the positive regulatory site D in the miR-122
promoter, whereas eEF1A1 interacted with Sp1 to bind to the negative regulatory
site E and inhibit miR-122 transcription. Significantly, both Sp1 and eEF1A1
levels were enhanced, but C/EBPα and miR-122 expression were reduced in HCC
tissues. Knockdown of eEF1A1 enhanced miR-122 level and inhibited cell growth,
and these effects were abrogated when Sp1 was silenced. Consistently, the
promoter activity enhanced by site E deletion was attenuated by silencing Sp1.
Moreover, reduction of miR-122 resulted from Sp1 overexpression was rescued by
coexpressing C/EBPα. These data suggest that C/EBPα and eEF1A1 may play opposing 
roles in Sp1-regulating miR-122 transcription, and the eEF1A1 upregulation
accompanied by C/EBPα downregulation in HCC may switch the regulatory functions
of Sp1 and led to reduced miR-122 transcription. These findings highlight the
complex regulatory network of miR-122 expression and its significance in
hepatocarcinogenesis.Abbreviations: MiRNA: microRNA; HCC, hepatocellular

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection compromises the natural defense mechanisms of
the liver leading to a progressive end stage disease such as cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatic stress response generated due to
viral replication in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergoes a stepwise
transition from adaptive to pro-survival signaling to improve host cell survival 
and liver disease progression. The minute details of hepatic pro-survival
unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling that contribute to HCC development in
cirrhosis are unknown. This study shows that the UPR sensor, the protein kinase
RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), mediates the pro-survival signaling through nuclear
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in a persistent HCV infection
model of Huh-7.5 liver cells. The NRF2-mediated STAT3 activation in persistently 
infected HCV cell culture model resulted in the decreased expression of
hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), a major liver-specific transcription
factor. The stress-induced inhibition of HNF4A expression resulted in a
significant reduction of liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) transcription. It 
was found that the reversal of hepatic adaptive pro-survival signaling and
restoration of miR-122 level was more efficient by interferon (IFN)-based
antiviral treatment than direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). To test whether miR-122
levels could be utilized as a biomarker of hepatic adaptive stress response in
HCV infection, serum miR-122 level was measured among healthy controls, and
chronic HCV patients with or without cirrhosis. Our data show that serum miR-122 
expression level remained undetectable in most of the patients with cirrhosis
(stage IV fibrosis), suggesting that the pro-survival UPR signaling increases the
risk of HCC through STAT3-mediated suppression of miR-122. In conclusion, our
data indicate that hepatic pro-survival UPR signaling suppresses the
liver-specific HNF4A and its downstream target miR-122 in cirrhosis. These
results provide an explanation as to why cirrhosis is a risk factor for the
development of HCC in chronic HCV infection.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is known as a serious problem in the domain of 
public health and approximately 350 million people across the world are affected 
with this infectious disease. As well, microRNAs are recognized as a type of
small non-coding RNAs that can be widely used as a diagnostic biomarker and
prognosis method of special diseases. In this respect, microRNA-122 or miR-122
can play a significant role in the pathogenesis of several hepatic diseases.
Given the importance of microRNA-122 in the liver as well as its pathology, this 
study focused on the potential functions of microRNA-122 in pathogenesis,
diagnosis, and treatment of HBV infection. In this regard, the findings of
previous studies had indicated that expression of microRNA-122 in patients with
HBV infection could be significantly deregulated. The results of this study were 
consistent with the idea that diagnosis and treatment of this infectious disease 
using microRNA-122 could be an efficient method.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer, the
third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with over 500,000 people affected.
It is a major cause of death in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection. Overwhelming lines of epidemiological evidence have indicated that
persistent infection with HCV is a major risk for the development of HCC.
Although a proportion of patients with a chronic hepatitis C virus infection
progress to HCC, the peak incidence of HCC associated with HCV infection has not 
yet occurred.
AIM: This review aimed to assess the impact of hepatitis C viral load on the
development of HCC as a correlation between mir-122 and, the key factor in
fibrogenesis, CCL2.
CONCLUSION: According to the detailed explanation of the role of mir-122 and CCL2
in HCV and HCC and the evidence of the inverse correlation between them, it may
be concluded that HCV may affect mir-122 expression level of the hepatocytes with
different patterns depending on the viral genotype. Collectively, HCV viral load 
alone is not sufficient to predict the HCC development and progression. Besides
the quantitative evaluation of the HCV, mir-122 and CCL2 determinations should
also be taken into consideration.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) harnesses host dependencies to infect human hepatocytes. 
We previously identified a pivotal role of IκB kinase α (IKK-α) in regulating
cellular lipogenesis and HCV assembly. In this study, we defined and
characterized NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) as an IKK-α upstream serine/threonine
kinase in IKK-α-mediated proviral effects and the mechanism whereby HCV exploits 
this innate pathway to its advantage. We manipulated NIK expression in Huh7.5.1
cells through loss- and gain-of-function approaches and examined the effects on
IKK-α activation, cellular lipid metabolism, and viral assembly. We demonstrated 
that NIK interacts with IKK-α to form a kinase complex in association with the
stress granules, in which IKK-α is phosphorylated upon HCV infection. Depletion
of NIK significantly diminished cytosolic lipid droplet content and impaired HCV 
particle production. NIK overexpression enhanced HCV assembly, and this process
was abrogated in cells deprived of IKK-α, suggesting that NIK acts upstream of
IKK-α. NIK abundance was increased in HCV-infected hepatocytes, liver tissues
from Alb-uPA/Scid mice engrafted with human hepatocytes, and chronic hepatitis C 
patients. NIK mRNA contains an miR-122 seed sequence binding site in the 3'
untranslated region (UTR). miR-122 mimic and hairpin inhibitor directly affected 
NIK levels. In our hepatic models, miR-122 levels were significantly reduced by
HCV infection. We demonstrated that HNF4A, a known transcriptional regulator of
pri-miR-122, was downregulated by HCV infection. NIK represents a bona fide
target of miR-122 whose transcription is downregulated by HCV through reduced
HNF4A expression. This effect, together with the sequestering of miR-122 by HCV
replication, results in "derepression" of NIK expression to deregulate lipid
metabolism.IMPORTANCE Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global
public health problem. Infection often leads to severe liver injury that may
progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. HCV coopts cellular
machineries for propagation and triggers pathological processes in the liver. We 
previously identified a pivotal role of IKK-α in regulating cellular lipid
metabolism and HCV assembly. In this study, we characterized NIK as acting
upstream of IKK-α and characterized how HCV exploits this innate pathway to its
advantage. Through extensive mechanistic studies, we demonstrated that NIK is a
direct target of miR-122, which is regulated at the transcription level by HNF4A,
a hepatocyte-specific transcription factor. We show in HCV infection that NIK
expression is increased while both HNF4A and miR-122 levels are decreased. NIK
represents an important host dependency that links HCV assembly, hepatic
lipogenesis, and miRNA biology.

Background/objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multistep process
starting from chronic hepatitis (CH) that progress through cirrhosis to HCC. The 
expression level of microRNA (miRNA) was found to be deregulated in HCC. The
study was designed to find out whether the expression level of miR-21 and miR-122
was deregulated in HCC compared to controls without HCC.
Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to find
out the miRNA expression level using Ct value followed by statistical analysis
where P value ≤ 0.05 was considered as significant.
Results: Overexpression of miR-21 and miR-122 in HCC was detected. All changes in
the expression level of miR-21 and miR-122 were due to HCC compared with healthy 
control, CH, and liver cirrhosis. Hence miR-21 and miR-122 are suitable to
differentiate HCC with an efficient diagnostic power of sensitivity, specificity,
and expression level, but they might not have any role in patients' survival.
Conclusion: miR-21 and miR-122 could be considered as potential markers of HCC
screening molecule in addition to other approved markers. However the current
study is limited to expression levels of miRNAs from serum; therefore, it needs
further validated study in a large group of population to fulfill all the
criteria of a biomarker.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer with high
mortality, due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. Blood miRNAs,
which circulate in a highly stable, cell-free form, show promise as novel
potential biomarkers for early detection of HCC. Whole miRNome profiling was
performed to identify deregulated miRNAs between HCC and normal healthy (NH)
volunteers. These deregulated miRNAs were validated in an independent cohort of
HCC, NH and chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) volunteers and finally in a 3rd cohort
comprising NH, CHB, cirrhotic and HCC volunteers to evaluate miRNA changes during
disease progression. The associations between circulating miRNAs and liver-damage
markers, clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were analysed 
to identify prognostic markers. Twelve miRNAs are differentially expressed
between HCC and NH individuals in all three cohorts. Five upregulated miRNAs
(miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-885-5p, miR-100-5p and miR-148a-3p) in CHB,
cirrhosis and HCC patients are potential biomarkers for CHB infection, while
miR-34a-5p can be a biomarker for cirrhosis. Notably, four miRNAs (miR-1972,
miR-193a-5p, miR-214-3p and miR-365a-3p) can distinguish HCC from other non-HCC
individuals. Six miRNAs are potential prognostic markers for overall survival.

Enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) is the core
component of polycomb repressive complex 2 and is overexpressed in several types 
of solid malignancies. It has been reported that EZH2 contributes to sorafenib
resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its underlying molecular
mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that EZH2 induced
sorafenib resistance of HCC cells in vitro. Mechanistically, EZH2 was a potent
regulator of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and EZH2-modulated
IGF1R expression by directly transcriptionally repressing a set of microRNAs
(miRNAs) including miR-101, miR-122, miR-125b, and miR-139. These miRNAs were
required for EZH2-mediated sorafenib resistance by promoting IGF1R expression.
Surprisingly, IGF1R inhibitors significantly reversed EZH2-induced sorafenib
resistance. Collectively, we proposed a novel model for an EZH2 - miRNAs - IGF1R 
regulatory axis, which might provide insights into how EZH2 contributes to
sorafenib resistance in HCC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe disease with high mortality in the
world. It has been shown that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) might play a role in
HCC. The aim of the present study was to identify the role of long intergenic
noncoding RNA 01551 (LINC01551) in the HCC development and explore the underlying
mechanism of LINC01551/miR-122-5p/ADAM10 axis. The differentially expressed
lncRNAs associated with HCC were screened out by a microarray analysis. The
expression of LINC01551, miR-122-5p, and ADAM10 was determined in HCC tissues and
cells. The potential miRNA (miR-122-5p) regulated by LINC01551 was explored, and 
the target relationship between miR-122-5p and ADAM10 was confirmed. To evaluate 
the effect of LINC01551 and miR-122-5p on proliferation, migration, invasion, and
apoptosis of HCC, different plasmids were delivered into MHCC97-H cells. High
expression of LINC01551 and ADAM10 yet low-expression of miR-122-5p were revealed
in HCC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-122-5p could downregulate ADAM10.
Biological prediction websites and fluorescence in situ hybridization assay
verified that LINC01551 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. Silencing
LINC01551 reduced HCC cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and
cell cycle entry yet induce cell apoptosis. Upregulation of LINC01551 increased
its ability of competitively binding to miR-122-5p, thus reducing miR-122-5p and 
upregulating ADAM10 expression, as well as promoting the proliferative,
migrative, and invasive ability. Taken together the results, it is highly
possible that LINC01551 functions as an competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to
regulate the miRNA target ADAM10 by sponging miR-122-5p and therefore promotes
the development of HCC, highlighting a promising competitive new target for the
HCC treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the value of ultrasomics in temporal monitoring of tumor
changes in response to gene therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with
methods according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
and modified RECIST (mRECIST).
METHODS: Hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing mice were injected intratumorally with 
microRNA-122 (miR-122) mimics and an miR-122 negative control in the treatment
and control groups, respectively. The injections were performed every 3 days for 
5 times (on days 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12). Before each injection and at the experiment
ending, 2-dimensional ultrasound imaging was performed for tumor size measurement
with RECIST and computing a quantitative imaging analysis with ultrasomics. To
analyze the tumor perfusion by mRECIST, perfusion parameters were analyzed
offline based on dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound image videos using
SonoLiver software (TomTec, Unterschleissheim, Germany) on day 13. Tumor miR-122 
expression was then analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction experiments.
RESULTS: Tumors in mice treated with miR-122 mimics demonstrated a mean ± SD 763-
± 60-fold increase in miR-122 levels compared with tumors in the control group.
With RECIST, a significant therapeutic response evaluated by tumor size changes
was detected after day 9 (days 9, 12, and 13; P < .001). With mRECIST, no
parameters showed significant differences (P > .05). Significant different
features of the 2-dimensional ultrasound images between the groups were detected 
by the ultrasomics analysis, and the model could be successfully built. The
ultrasomics score values between the groups were statistically significant after 
day 6 (days 6, 9, 12, and 13; P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasomics revealed significant changes after the second injection 
of miR-122, showing the potential as an important imaging biomarker for gene
therapy.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell culture systems have facilitated the development of 
efficient direct-acting antivirals against HCV. Huh-7.5, a subline of the human
hepatoma cell line Huh-7, has been used widely to amplify HCV because HCV can
efficiently replicate in these cells due to a defect in innate antiviral
signalling. Recently, we established a novel cell line, KH, derived from human
hepatocellular carcinoma, which showed atypical uptake of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) in a Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging study. KH cells expressed hepatocyte markers including
microRNA-122 (miR-122) at a lower level than Huh-7.5 cells. We demonstrated that 
KH cells could support the entire life cycle of HCV; however, HCV replicated at a
lower rate in KH cells compared to Huh-7.5 cells, and virus particles produced
from KH cells seemed to have some disadvantages in viral assembly compared with
those produced from Huh-7.5 cells. KH cells had more robust interferon-stimulated
gene expression and induction upon HCV RNA transfection, interferon-α2b addition,
and HCV infection than Huh-7.5 cells. Interestingly, both miR-122 supplementation
and IRF3 knockout in KH cells boosted HCV replication to a similar level as in
Huh-7.5 cells, suggesting that intact innate antiviral signalling and lower
miR-122 expression limit HCV replication in KH cells. KH cells will enable a
deeper understanding of the role of the innate immune response in persistent HCV 
infection.

Dynamic Changes in Circulating MicroRNA Levels in Liver Cancer Patients
Undergoing Thermal Ablation and Transarterial Chemoembolization.

Zavadil J, Juráček J, Čechová B, Andrašina T, Slabý O, Goldberg N.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic cancer patients who cannot undergo surgical resection of
tumour are candidates for methods of interventional radiology - transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) or thermal ablative (TA) therapy. Both methods are
causing characteristic changes in liver tissue (inflammatory immune response,
hypoxia, elevated temperature, tissue destruction) which are accompanied with
systemic secretion of cytokines or microRNAs (miRNAs). The aim of our study was
to investigate whether the level of circulating miRNAs related to hypoxia (miR-21
and miR-210), liver injury (miR-122) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(miR-200a) could reflect systemic effect of these intervention techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study consisted of 10 primary hepatocellular carcinoma
patients treated with TACE and 10 patients with liver metastases of colorectal
cancer treated with TA. Thermal ablation was performed using the radiofrequency
or microwave generator (RITA, Microsulis, AngioDynamics,Inc), for TACE drug
eluting beads (DCBeads, Biocompatibles Ltd.) were used. Tumours were evaluated
using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), mRECIST (modified
RECIST) criterion and volumetry. For all patients we determined concentrations of
miRNA in blood plasma samples from four time points (before intervention,
immediately after intervention, 24 hours after intervention, 1 week after
intervention) using TaqMan® Assays and quantitative real time polymerase chain
reaction method.
RESULTS: After both intervention techniques we observed changes in circulating
miRNA levels. In TA cases we observed significant increase of miR-122 and
miR-200a concentrations immediately after intervention, on the contrary in TACE
we observed increase in miRNA concentration at time point 24 hours after
intervention (miR-21, miR-210, miR-122, miR-200a). Increased concentration of
circulating miRNA was followed by subsequent decline to initial level. These
changes were consistent with presumed biological effect of TA and TACE on tumour 
tissue.
CONCLUSION: Data of this pilot study show potential usage of circulating miRNA
for monitoring of systemic effect of thermal ablative and intraarterial
therapies. This work was created at Masaryk University as part of the project

The clinical significance of microRNA-122 in predicting the prognosis of patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis validated by the Cancer Genome
Atlas dataset.

Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.

BACKGROUND: Although the prognostic value of microRNA-122 (miR-122) for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients have been evaluated by numerous studies, 
the results of them were not completely consistent. The present study aims to
comprehensively evaluate the predicting value of miR-122 on the prognosis of
patients with HCC based on all eligible literatures.
METHODS: Numerous electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Pubmed, Google Scholar, 
and China Biology Medicine disc) were applied to retrieve relevant studies.
Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used as primary
endpoints. All statistical analyses were performed by RevMan software version
5.3.5 and STATA software version 14.1. In addition, the results of this
meta-analysis were validated by an independent dataset from the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA).
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies containing 1124 patients were included in this
meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that low miR-122 expression in HCC
tissues significantly associated with unfavorable OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48,
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.80, P < .001) and PFS (HR = 1.54, 95% CI
1.28-1.85, P < .001) in patients with HCC. However, the expression level of
miR-122 in blood did not have the ability in predicting OS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI
0.44-1.28, P = .29) and PFS (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.20, P = .33) of HCC.
Subgroup analysis further indicated that low expression of miR-122 in tumor
tissues predicted poor OS in HCC patients who received curative liver resection
(HR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.08-3.70, P = .03). Analysis using TCGA dataset suggested
that low miR-122 expression in HCC tissues was significantly associated with OS
(HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.27, P = .008) other than PFS (HR = 1.30, 95% CI
0.96-1.75, P = .09).
CONCLUSION: Low miR-122 expression in HCC tissues was a reliable indicator for
predicting the OS of HCC patients who underwent curative resection. Owing to the 
disagreement between this meta-analysis and the TCGA dataset, the predictive
value of miR-122 in tissues for PFS needs to be verified by future well-designed 
studies with large sample size.

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) capable of controlling antioxidative capacity remains
to be investigated. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a
central molecule for cellular defense that increases antioxidative capacity. We
identified a novel lncRNA named Nrf2-activating lncRNA (Nrf2-lncRNA) transcribed 
from an upstream region of the microRNA 122 gene (MIR122). Nrf2-lncRNA existed in
the cytoplasm, suggestive of its function as a competing endogenous RNA [ceRNA,
microRNA (miRNA) sponge]. Nrf2-lncRNA served as a ceRNA for polo-like kinase
(Plk) 2 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21cip1) through binding of
miRNA 128 and miRNA 224, inducing Plk2/Nrf2/p21cip1 complexation for Nrf2
activation in the cells under p53-activating conditions (i.e., DNA damage and
serum deprivation). Nrf2-lncRNA expression was suppressed with the initiation of 
apoptosis, being a rheostat for cell fate determination. Nrf2-lncRNA levels
correlated with the recurrence-free postsurgery survival rate of patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, Nrf2-lncRNA promotes Plk2 and p21cip1
translation by competing for specific miRNAs and activating Nrf2 under surviving 
conditions from oxidative stress, implying that Nrf2-lncRNA serves as a
fine-tuning rheostat for cell fate decision.-Joo, M. S., Shin, S.-B., Kim, E. J.,

p53-dependent Nrf2 activation as an miRNA sponge for Plk2 and p21cip1.

The only first-line treatment approved for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) is sorafenib. Since many patients experience drug resistance, the discovery
of more effective therapeutic strategies represents an unmet clinical need.
MicroRNA (MiR)-122 is downregulated in most HCCs, while oncogenic SerpinB3 is
upregulated. Here, we assessed the relationship between miR-122 and SerpinB3 and 
their influence on cell phenotype and sorafenib resistance in HCC. A
bioinformatics analysis identified SerpinB3 among hypothetical miR-122 targets.
In SerpinB3-overexpressing HepG2 cells, miR-122 transfection decreased SerpinB3
mRNA and protein levels, whereas miR-122 inhibition increased SerpinB3
expression. Luciferase assay demonstrated the interaction between miR-122 and
SerpinB3 mRNA. In an HCC rat model, high miR-122 levels were associated with
negative SerpinB3 expression, while low miR-122 levels correlated with SerpinB3
positivity. A negative correlation between miR-122 and SerpinB3 or stem cell
markers was found in HCC patients. Anti-miR-122 transfection increased cell
viability in sorafenib-treated Huh-7 cells, while miR-122 overexpression
increased sorafenib sensitivity in treated cells, but not in those overexpressing
SerpinB3. In conclusion, we demonstrated that miR-122 targets SerpinB3, and its
low levels are associated with SerpinB3 positivity and a stem-like phenotype in
HCC. MiR-122 replacement therapy in combination with sorafenib deserves attention
as a possible therapeutic strategy in SerpinB3-negative HCCs.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA may affect its expression and 
regulation of target genes, which may consequently alter individual
susceptibility to cancer. In this study we aimed to investigate associations
between miR-122 polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a southern
Chinese population. Three selected SNPs in miR-122 (rs9966765, rs1135519, and
rs17669) were genotyped in 1050 HCC patients and 1079 cancer-free controls using 
Sequenom MassARRAY platform and the associations of the three SNPs and HCC risk
were evaluated. We found that individuals with the rs1135519 CC genotypes had a
significant increased risk of HCC than those with TT genotypes (adjusted OR=2.71,
95% CI=1.15-6.36, and P=0.022), while the rs9966765 CC genotypes showed a
borderline significant association with increased risk of HCC when compared with 
the GG genotypes (adjusted OR=2.38, 95% CI=0.99-5.75, and P=0.052). There was
also a significant increased risk of HCC when combining risk genotypes of these
loci, i.e., rs1135519 CC and rs9966765 CC. Compared with the low-risk group (0
risk genotype), the high risk group (1-2 risk genotypes) had significantly
increased risk of HCC (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.05-2.44, and P=0.028). Further
genotype-expression analysis revealed that cases carrying the CC genotype of
rs1135519 had lower levels of miR-122 expression than those with the TT genotype.
Our results suggest that SNP of rs1135519 modulates miR-122 expression and
contributes to the genetic susceptibility of HCC, either independently or
together with rs9966765 in miR-122. Further well-designed studies with lager
sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings.

miR-122 is a highly expressed liver microRNA that is activated perinatally and
aids in regulating cholesterol metabolism and promoting terminal differentiation 
of hepatocytes. Disrupting expression of miR-122 can re-activate embryo-expressed
adult-silenced genes, ultimately leading to the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Here we interrogate the liver transcriptome at various time
points after genomic excision of miR-122 to determine the cellular consequences
leading to oncogenesis. Loss of miR-122 leads to specific and progressive
increases in expression of imprinted clusters of microRNAs and mRNA transcripts
at the Igf2 and Dlk1-Dio3 loci that could be curbed by re-introduction of
exogenous miR-122. mRNA targets of other abundant hepatic microRNAs are
functionally repressed leading to widespread hepatic transcriptional
de-regulation. Together, this reveals a transcriptomic framework for the hepatic 
response to loss of miR-122 and the outcome on other microRNAs and their cognate 
gene targets.

In order to determine the diagnostic efficacy of microRNA (miR)-122-5p and to
identify the potential molecular signaling pathways underlying the function of
miR-122-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression profiles of data
collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and 
literature databases were analyzed, along with any associations between
clinicopathological characteristics and the diagnostic value of miR-122-5p in
HCC. The intersection of 12 online prediction databases and differentially
expressed genes from TCGA and GEO were utilized in order to select the
prospective target genes of miR-122-5p in HCC. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interaction network 
(PPI) analyses were subsequently performed based on the selected target genes.
The average expression level of miR-122-5p was decreased in HCC patients compared
with controls from TCGA database (P<0.001), and the downregulation of miR-122-5p 
was significantly associated with HCC tissues (P<0.001), tumor vascular invasion 
(P<0.001), metastasis (P=0.001), sex (P=0.006), virus infection status (P=0.001) 
and tissue (compared with serum; P<0.001) in cases from the GEO database. The
pooled sensitivity and specificity for miR-122-5p to diagnose HCC were 0.60 [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 0.48-0.71] and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.89), respectively. 
The area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.80), while in
Meta-DiSc 1.4, the AUC was 0.76 (Q*=0.70). The pooled sensitivity and specificity
were 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.81), respectively. A total
of 198 overlapping genes were selected as the potential target genes of
miR-122-5p, and 7 genes were defined as the hub genes from the PPI network. Cell 
division cycle 6 (CDC6), minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 (MCM4)
and MCM8, which serve pivotal functions in the occurrence and development of HCC,
were the most significant hub genes. The regulation of cell proliferation for
cellular adhesion and the biosynthesis of amino acids was highlighted in the GO
and KEGG pathway analyses. The downregulation of miR-122-5p in HCC demonstrated
diagnostic value, worthy of further attention. Therefore, miR-122-5p may function
as a tumor suppressor by modulating genome replication.

The prevalence of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been identified world-wide. 
Plethora of factors including chronic infection of HBV/HCV has been characterized
for the development of HCC. Although the onset and progression of HCC has been
linked with awry of various signaling pathways but precise mechanism, still lies 
under the multitude layers of curiosity. HBV is spreading with insane speed
throughout the world and has been found a main culprit in HCC development after
regulating the several cellular pathways including Wnt/β-catenin, Raf/MAPK, Akt
and affecting cell multiplication to genomic instability. The role of
Wnt/FZD/β-catenin signaling pathway is centralized in liver functions and its
anomalous activation leads to HCC development. β-catenin mainly plays a pivotal
role in canonical pathway of the system. Altered mainly overexpression of
β-catenin along its nuclear localization tunes the aberrations in liver functions
and set disease progression. In the development of HCC, modulation of
Wnt/FZD/β-catenin signaling pathway by HBV has been established. As HBV infects
the cell it affects the miRNAs, the master regulators of cell. Previous studies
showed the connection between HBV and cellular miRNAs. In the present review, we 
unveiled how HBV is deciphering the cellular miRNAs like miR-26a, miR-15a,
miR-16-1, miR-148a, miR-132, miR-122, miR-34a, miR-21, miR-29a, miR-222 and
miR-199a/b-3p to modulate the Wnt/FZD/β-catenin signaling pathway and develop
HCC. These HBV mediated miRNAs may prove future therapeutic options to treat
HBV-Wnt/FZD/β-catenin associated HCC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide. China accounts for over half of the new cases and deaths.
Diagnostic imprecision and a lack of complimentary molecular biomarkers are
partially responsible for this lack of progress. Herein, serum-derived exosomal
microRNA (miRNA) profiling was performed on 80 patients which histologically
confirmed HCC and 30 normal controls. A classification of 8 exosomal miRNAs had
biologically and statistically significant differences between HCC and normal
serum samples, including miR-122, miR-125b, miR-145, miR-192, miR-194, miR-29a,
miR-17-5p, and miR-106a. Online algorithm showed strong independent
classification accuracy (area under the curve) reached 0.535 to 0.850,
separately. The significant correlation between serum exosomal miRNAs and tumor
size was observed. In addition, the survival difference of HCC patients with high
or low exosomal miR-106a was statistically significant using Kaplan-Meier
analysis. Besides, we also measured the proliferation and invasion ability of HCC
cells following exosomal miR-106a mimics or inhibitor treatment. After prediction
with algorithms, mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
pathways were identified associated with miR-106a's function. In summary,
differentially expressed serum exosomal miRNAs can be helpful for diagnostic and 
prognostic of HCC.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a pivotal liver-specific miRNA, is frequently
repressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated with poor prognosis.
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR has been proved to function as an oncogene in
multiple cancers including HCC. However, the relationship between HOTAIR and
miR-122 in HCC remains largely unknown.
METHODS: We investigated the function of HOTAIR and miR-122 in HCC cell models
and a xenograft mouse model. The regulatory network between HOTAIR and miR-122
was further detected following overexpression or knockdown of HOTAIR. DNA
methylation status of miR-122 promoter region, as well as expression levels of
DNMTs, EZH2 and Cyclin G1 were analyzed.
FINDINGS: In this study, we found that HOTAIR was highly expressed whereas
miR-122 was suppressed in HCC, and HOTAIR negatively regulated miR-122 expression
in HCC cells. Furthermore, knockdown of HOTAIR dramatically inhibited HCC cell
proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in vitro and suppressed
tumorigenicity in vivo by upregulating miR-122 expression. Mechanistically, a CpG
island was located in the miR-122 promoter region. HOTAIR epigenetically
suppressed miR-122 expression via DNMTs-mediated DNA methylation. Moreover,
HOTAIR upregulated DNMTs expression via EZH2. In addition, suppression of miR-122
induced by HOTAIR directly reactivated oncogene Cyclin G1 expression.
Collectively, our results suggest that HOTAIR epigenetically suppresses miR-122
expression via DNA methylation, leading to activation of Cyclin G1 and promotion 
of tumorigenicity in HCC, which provide new insight into the mechanism of
HOTAIR-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis via suppressing miR-122.

Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have been investigated as potential novel biomarkers,
and miR-122 and miR-21 were shown to be important in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). We analyzed the importance of serum exosomal miRNA expression levels in
HCC patients that underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Seventy-five 
HCC patients who underwent TACE as the initial treatment in Nagasaki University
Hospital were enrolled. Exosomal miRNAs were isolated from serum samples
collected before and after TACE. Exosomal miR-122 expression levels significantly
decreased after TACE (P=0.012), while the exosomal miR-21 expression levels did
not significantly change. The expression levels of exosomal miR-122 before TACE
were shown to correlate significantly with aspartate aminotransferase (r=0.31,
P=0.004) and alanine aminotransferase (r=0.33, P=0.003) levels, tumor diameter
(r=0.29, P=0.010) and Child-Pugh score (r=-0.28, P=0.013). The median survival
time for all patients was 47 months, and neither of the investigated exosomal
miRNAs were shown to be independent factors associated with the disease-specific 
survival. According to the median relative expression of miR-122 after
TACE/before TACE (miR-122 ratio) in liver cirrhosis patients (n=57), the patients
with a higher miR-122 ratio had significantly longer disease-specific survival,
compared with that of the patients with the lower miR-122 ratio (P=0.0461).
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of clinical parameters 
revealed that a lower exosomal miR-122 ratio (HR 2.720; 95% confidence interval, 
1.035-8.022; P=0.042) is associated with the disease-specific survival. Taken
together, our results demonstrate that the exosomal miR-122 level alterations may
represent a predictive biomarker in HCC patients with liver cirrhosis treated
with TACE.

Seventy percent of people infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) will suffer
chronic infection, putting them at risk for liver disease, including
hepatocellular carcinoma. The full range of mechanisms that render some people
more susceptible to chronic infection and liver disease is still being
elucidated. XRN exonucleases can restrict HCV replication and may help to resolve
HCV infections. However, it is unknown how 5' triphosphorylated HCV transcripts, 
primary products of the viral polymerase, become susceptible to attack by 5'
monophosphate-specific XRNs. Here, we show that the 5' RNA triphosphatase DUSP11 
acts on HCV transcripts, rendering them susceptible to XRN-mediated attack. Cells
lacking DUSP11 show substantially enhanced HCV replication, and this effect is
diminished when XRN expression is reduced. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a target of
current phase II anti-HCV drugs, is known to protect HCV transcripts against
XRNs. We show that HCV replication is less dependent on miR-122 in cells lacking 
DUSP11. Combined, these results implicate DUSP11 as an important component of
XRN-mediated restriction of HCV.

AIM: To determine a panel of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be used as novel
biomarkers for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: We initially screened 9 out of 754 serum miRNAs by TaqMan Low Density
Array in two pooled samples respectively from 35 HCC and 35 normal controls, and 
then validated individually by RT-qPCR in another 114 patients and 114 controls
arranged in two phases. The changes of the selected miRNAs after operation and
their prognostic value were examined.
RESULTS: miR-375, miR-10a, miR-122 and miR-423 were found to be significantly
higher in HCC than in controls (P < 0.0001), and the area under the
receiver-operating-characteristic curve for the 4-miRNA panel was 0.995 (95%CI:
0.985-1). All the four miRNAs were significantly reduced after surgical removal
of the tumors (P < 0.0001), while still higher than normal controls (at least P <
0.05).
CONCLUSION: The four serum miRNAs (miR-375, miR-10a, miR-122 and miR-423) could
potentially serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnostic and prognostic of HCC.

BACKGROUND: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an over accumulation of 
triglyceride in the liver without alcohol consumption. Its major cause is insulin
resistance. Patients with NAFLD can develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that
regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing. Previous research reported that
miR-29 family (a, b and c) and miR-122 have an important role in regulating
insulin resistance related to NAFLD.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate that miR-29 and miR-122
can be possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD.
METHOD: Serum samples were collected from 58 NAFLD patients and 34 healthy
controls. MiRNAs were extracted from serum by using microRNA purification kit
followed by polyuridylation, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time
PCR. Also, we analyzed the correlation between miR-29 and miR-122 and level of
liver inflammation in NAFLD patients.
RESULTS: We found that the serum miR-29a levels in NAFLD patients were
significantly lower (P = 0.006) than the control group, while miR-29c levels were
unchanged, and miR-29b levels were undetectable. However, we found that serum
miR-122 levels in NAFLD patients were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those
found in the control group. For miR-29a, the area under curve (AUC) was 0.679 (P 
= 0.0065) with 60.87% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity. For miR-122, the AUC
was 0.831 (P < 0.0001) with 75.00% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity.
Interestingly, the levels of serum miR- 122 were significantly different between 
patients without steatohepatitis (NAS < 4) and steatohepatitis (NAS ≥ 4),
indicating that the levels of miR-122 were related to the severity of NAFLD.
CONCLUSION: The levels of miR-29a and miR-122 might be beneficial and compelling 
as possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membranous vesicles secreted from normal, 
diseased, and transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. EVs have been found to play
a critical role in cell-to-cell communication by transferring non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and so on. Emerging 
evidence shows that transferring biological information through EVs to
neighboring cells in intercellular communication not only keep physiological
functions, but also participate in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. Liver
diseases often promote release of EVs and/or in different cargo sorting into
these EVs. Either of these modifications can promote disease pathogenesis. Given 
this fact, EV-associated ncRNAs, such as miR-192, miR-122 and lncRNA-ROR and so
on, can serve as new diagnostic biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for liver 
disease, because altered EV-associated ncRNAs may reflect the underlying liver
disease condition. In this review, we focus on understanding the emerging role of
EV-associated ncRNAs in viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis
(AH), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
discuss their utility in biomarker discovery and therapeutics. A better
understanding of this multifaceted pattern of communication between different
type cells in liver may contribute to developing novel approaches for
personalized diagnostics and therapeutics.

With increasing incidence and mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of
the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In this study,
microRNA-122 (miR-122) mimics and relevant control oligonucleotides were
transfected into HepG2 cells in vitro, followed by coptisine (COP) and sorafenib 
treatments. Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were evaluated by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and
colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, Hoechst 33258 staining and flow
cytometry, respectively. Histopathology and miR-122 were analyzed by haemotoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining and real-time RT-PCR, respectively; whereas, the
relevant protein expressions were detected by western blot. In vivo, COP enhanced
the expression of miR-122 by 160% compared to control in male BALB/c nude mice;
COP not only protected the liver morphology but also showed a significant
anti-cancer effect. Further, there was no remarkable difference between the tumor
weights in the COP and sorafenib groups, but there was a striking difference to
the tumor control group (p < 0.05). Hence, COP inhibited the proliferation,
migration and promoted apoptosis of HCC cells; moreover, it inhibited the tumor
growth in nude mice by up-regulating the expression of miR-122.

A combination of different therapy strategies has great potential to
efficaciously treat malignant tumors, by virtue of their synergetic effects.
Herein, a co-delivery system based on gold nanocages (AuNCs) was designed to
deliver both doxorubicin (DOX) and microRNA-122 mimic (miR-122) for an enhanced
cancer therapy. DOX was loaded into the AuNCs and miR-122 was condensed onto the 
surface of the functionalized AuNCs by an electrostatic interaction.
Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were also introduced to the
co-delivery system for targeted drug delivery. We evaluated the cellular uptake, 
biodistribution and anti-tumor effect in vitro and in vivo. Our results
demonstrated an effective delivery of DOX and miR-122 into tumor cells and the
tumor tissue. Importantly, the triple therapy, namely the combination of
chemotherapy, gene therapy and photothermal therapy, mediated by this
multifunctional drug delivery system, exhibited better anti-tumor effect than any
single therapy, both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, this drug delivery
system caused insignificant toxicity to the major organs and had no obvious
effect on the body weight of the mice. It could be concluded that multifunctional
AuNCs are promising as a co-delivery vector for an enhanced anti-tumor effect.

BACKGROUND: Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are biomarkers for several neoplastic
diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a literature
search, followed by experimental screening and validation in order to establish a
miRNA panel in combination with the assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels 
and to evaluate its performance in HCC diagnostics.
METHODS: Expression of miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 406
serum samples from 118 Vietnamese patients with hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC, 69
patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 100 chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
patients and 119 healthy controls (HC).
RESULTS: Three miRNAs (mir-21, mir-122, mir-192) were expressed differentially
among the studied subgroups and positively correlated with AFP levels. The
individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high 
diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC =
0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex
miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions
(CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862). When AFP levels 
were used in combination with the triplex miRNA panel, the diagnostic performance
was significantly improved in discriminating HCC from the other groups (LC, AUC =
0.887; CHB, AUC = 0.948; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.887).
CONCLUSIONS: The three miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir-192, together with AFP, are
biomarkers that may be applied to improve diagnostics of HCC in HBV patients,
especially in HBV-related LC patients with normal AFP levels or HCC patients with
small tumor sizes.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4AII contributes to microRNA-122
regulation of hepatitis C virus replication.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive sense RNA virus that persistently infects
human liver, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV replication
requires the liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122). In contrast to canonical
miRNA-mediated repression via 3'UTR sites, miR-122 positively regulates HCV
replication by a direct interaction with the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the 
viral RNA. The protein factor requirements for this unusual miRNA regulation
remain poorly understood. Here, we identify eIF4AII, previously implicated in
miRNA-mediated repression via 3'UTR sites, as a host factor that is important for
HCV replication. We demonstrate that eIF4AII interacts with HCV RNA and that this
interaction is miR-122-dependent. We show that effective miR-122 binding to, and 
regulation of, HCV RNA are reduced following eIF4AII depletion. We find that the 
previously identified HCV co-factor CNOT1, which has also been implicated in
miRNA-mediated repression via 3'UTR sites, contributes to regulation of HCV by
eIF4AII. Finally, we show that eIF4AI knockdown alleviates the inhibition of HCV 
replication mediated by depletion of either eIF4AII or CNOT1. Our results suggest
a competition effect between the eIF4A proteins to influence HCV replication by
modulation of miR-122 function.

BACKGROUND: The liver-enriched microRNA-122 (miR-122) plays a crucial role in
pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with prognostic value. Recently,
miR-122 was also found to be related to many other cancers besides HCC. However, 
less study determined miR-122 expression and its clinical significance in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML).
METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the level of bone
marrow (BM) miR-122 in de novo AML patients. The clinical significance of miR-122
expression in AML was further investigated.
RESULTS: Among whole-cohort AML, lower expression of BM miR-122 was associated
with male patients, higher hemoglobin and favorable-karyotypes (P = 0.038, 0.006,
and 0.038, respectively). Among cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), lower
expression of BM miR-122 was correlated with DNMT3A wild type (P = 0.043).
Moreover, patients with lower expression of BM miR-122 presented lower complete
remission (CR) rate and shorter overall survival (OS) than those with higher
expression of BM miR-122 in CN-AML (P = 0.025 and 0.013, respectively). Cox
regression analyses further confirmed the prognostic value of BM miR-122
expression in CN-AML (P = 0.024). In follow-up patients, BM miR-122 expression
level in CR time was increased compared to diagnosis time, and was returned to
primary level when in relapse time again (P = 0.062 and 0.049, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that lower expression of BM miR-122 acted as 
an independent risk factor for OS in CN-AML.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common cancers worldwide, especially
in developing countries. Although the chronic infections of hepatitis B and C
viruses have been established as the etiological factors of HCC, the mechanism
for the tumorigenesis and development of HCC is still unclear. The liver-specific
microRNA-122 (miR-122), an established tumor-suppressor miRNA, is often
down-regulated in HCC, while the underlying mechanism is not well understood.
Here we report that the AU-rich element-binding factor AUF1 suppresses the
expression of Dicer1, the type III RNase that is required for microRNA
maturation, leading to the inhibited biogenesis of miR-122. Overexpression of
AUF1 led to the decreased expression of Dicer1 and miR-122, while the level of
the miR-122 precursor (pre-miR-122) was increased. On the other hand, siRNA of
AUF1 (siAUF1) increased the levels of Dicer1 mRNA and miR-122, but it reduced the
abundance of pre-miR-122. Consistent with the reported data, this study
demonstrated that AUF1 and Dicer1 showed opposite expression pattern in both
human HCC tissues and cell lines. In addition, AUF1 inhibited the expression of
Dicer1 by interacting with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and coding region
of DICER1 mRNA. Moreover, the knockdown of AUF1 by siRNA altered the expression
of other miRNAs and promoted HCC cell death. In conclusion, AUF1 down-regulates
the expression miR-122 by interacting with the 3'UTR and coding region of DICER1 
mRNA and suppressing Dicer1 expression. The AUF1/Dicer1/miR-122 pathway might
play a critical role in the development of HCC.

Exosomal microRNAs have recently been studied as the potential diagnostic marker 
for various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of
this study was to investigate serum exosomal microRNA profiles as HCC diagnostic 
marker. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blot were used to identify
serum exosomes. Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed 
microRNAs between HCC (n = 5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n = 5) groups. Three
upregulated and two downregulated microRNAs were selected for qPCR analysis. The 
levels of selected microRNAs were normalized to Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39
microRNA mimics. Serum exosomal level of miR-122, miR-148a, and miR-1246 was
further analyzed and significantly higher in HCC than LC and normal control (NC) 
groups (P < 0.001), but not different from chronic hepatitis group (P > 0.05).
The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic
performance of candidate microRNAs. Area under the curve (AUC) of miR-148a was
0.891 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.809-0.947] in discriminating HCC from LC, 
remarkably higher than alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (AUC: 0.712, 95% CI: 0.607-0.803).
Binary logistic regression was adopted to establish the diagnostic model for
discriminating HCC from LC. And the combination of miR-122, miR-148a, and AFP
increased the AUC to 0.931 (95% CI, 0.857-0.973), which can also be applied for
distinguishing early HCC from LC. miR-122 was the best for differentiating HCC
from NC (AUC: 0.990, 95% CI, 0.945-1.000). These data suggest that serum exosomal
microRNAs signature or their combination with traditional biomarker may be used
as a suitable peripheral screening tool for HCC.

AIM: Molecular characterization of the CD133+ stem cells associated with
hepatocarinogensis through identifying the expression patterns of specific
microRNAs (miRNAs).
METHODS: We investigated the expression pattern of 13 miRNAs in purified CD133+
cells separated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, chronic
hepatitis C (CHC), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
patients a long with bone marrow samples from the healthy volunteers and the LC
patients using custom miScript miRNA PCR array.
RESULTS: The differential expression of the 13 studied miRNAs in CD133+ cells
separated from the HCC patients' peripheral blood compared to the controls
revealed that miR-602, miR-181b, miR-101, miR-122, miR-192, miR-125a-5p, and
miR-221 were significantly up regulated (fold change = 1.8, 1.7, 2, 5.4, 1.6, 2.9
& 1.5 P value = 0.039, 0.0019, 0.0013, 0.0370, 00024, 0.000044 &0.000007
respectively). As for the HCC group compared to the CHC group; miR-602, miR-122, 
miR-181b, miR-125a-5p, and miR-192 were significantly up regulated (fold change =
13, 3.1, 2.8, 1.6 & 1.56, P value = 0.01, 0.001, 0.000004, 0.002 & 0.007
respectively). Upon comparing the HCC group to the LC group; miR-199a-3p,
miR-192, miR-122, miR-181b, miR-224, miR-125a-5p, and miR-885-5p were
significantly up regulated (fold change = 5, 6.7, 2.3, 3, 2.5, 4.2 & 39.5 P value
= 0.001025, 0.000024, 0.000472, 0.000278, 0.000004, 0.000075 & 0.0000001
respectively) whereas miR-22 was significantly down regulated (fold change = 0.57
P value = 0.00002). Only, miR-192, miR-122, miR-181b and miR-125a-5p were
significant common miRNAs in CD133+ cells of the HCC group compared to the other 
non-malignant groups.
CONCLUSION: We identified a miRNA panel comprised of four miRNAs (miR-192,
miR-122, miR-181b and miR-125a-5p) that may serve as a molecular tool for
characterization of the CD133+ cells associated with different stages of
hepatocarinogensis. This panel may aid in developing a new target therapy
specific for those CD133+ cells.

Chronic HCV with its longstanding complications of cirrhosis and HCC is a highly 
prevalent and challenging problem in Egypt. Recently, microRNAs are ranked as
potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCV related complications. The aim of
the present study was to evaluate the role of miRNA-122 and miRNA-155 for
prediction of progression of HCV infection and for diagnosis of HCC. A total of
92 chronic HCV patients [chronic HCV (group 1, n =32); chronic HCV with cirrhosis
(group 2, n=31); chronic HCV with HCC (group 3, n=29)] were enrolled into the
study. Expression of serum miRNA-122 and miRNA-155 was assayed by real-time PCR
in all participants. The serum level of miR-122 was significantly higher in
chronic HCV patients than in healthy controls and both of cirrhotic and HCC
patients (P < 0.001). Serum miR-155 was significantly elevated in HCC than in
controls and non-HCC patients (P < 0.001). MiR-155 at the cut-off value of >6.11 
for HCC diagnosis, had sensitivity and specificity of 72.4% and 95.2%,
respectively. In conclusion; microRNA-122 is a potential marker of progression of
hepatocytes injury in patients infected with HCV but not a reliable marker for
diagnosis of HCC. MicroRNA-155 is a relatively reliable marker for HCC detection.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious worldwide healthcare issue. Its
association with various liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
is well studied. However, the study on the relationship between HCV infection and
the development of insulin resistance and diabetes is very limited. Current
research has already elucidated some underlying mechanisms, especially on the
regulation of metabolism and insulin signalling by viral proteins. More studies
have emerged recently on the correlation between HCV infection-derived miRNAs and
diabetes and insulin resistance. However, no studies have been carried out to
directly address if these miRNAs, especially circulating miRNAs, have causal
effects on the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Here, we proposed 
a new perspective that circulating miRNAs can perform regulatory functions to
modulate gene expression in peripheral tissues leading to insulin resistance and 
diabetes, rather than just a passive factor associated with these pathological
processes. The detailed rationales were elaborated through comprehensive
literature review and bioinformatic analyses. miR-122 was identified to be one of
the most potential circulating miRNAs to cause insulin resistance. This result
along with the idea about the driver function of circulating miRNAs will promote 
further investigations that eventually lead to the development of novel
strategies to treat HCV infection-associated extrahepatic comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global public health concern that 
lacks efficient methods for early diagnosis. Accumulated evidence has revealed
great potential using microRNAs (miRNAs) as noninvasive biomarkers in HCC
detection.
METHODS: Serum miRNAs (miR21, miR122, miR-214, miR15b, and let-7f) were detected 
in 75 patients with HCC and 80 healthy controls (HC). In addition, 75 HCC tissues
and paired normal adjacent tissues were also analyzed for comparison. Quantified 
by real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of miRNAs.
RESULTS: We discovered significant up-regulation of miR-21 (P < 0.001) and
miR-15b (P < 0.001) as well as a down-regulation of miR-122 (P = 0.01) in HCC
tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Additionally, miR-21 (P < 0.001) 
and miR-15b (P < 0.001) levels were upregulated in serum and miR-214 (P = 0.01)
was decreased in HCC patients compared to that in healthy controls. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis showed that serum miR-21 (OR = 1.68, P = 0.012) and 
miR-15b (OR = 1.736, P = 0.012) were independently associated with HCC whereas
miR-214 (OR = 0.631, P = 0.006) was associated with a decreased risk of HCC. When
we employed miR-(21 + 122 + 15b) classifier as biomarkers, we could discriminate 
HCC tissues from adjacent non-tumor tissues with an AUC of 0.885 (specificity:
89.7%; sensitivity: 73.1%). In serum, the cluster of miR-(21 + 214 + 15b)
classifier (AUC = 0.887) had a sensitivity of 80.3% and a specificity of 87.0%
for HCC diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that these serum miRNAs may be useful markers for
discriminating HCC patients from healthy controls. Combined determination of
circulating miR-21, miR-122, miR-214, and miR-15b has great potential to serve as
an accurate and noninvasive biomarker for the early HCC preliminary screening.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular primary liver cancer
characterized by rapid progression, besides, resistance to traditional
chemotherapeutic agents. It has been shown that microRNAs play critical roles in 
regulation of tumor cell sensitivity to drugs through modulating the expression
of genes involved in drug transport. The present study investigated whether
restoration of miR-122 in HCC cells could alter the cell cycle distribution and
the expression of multidrug resistance (MDR)-related genes (ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCG2
and ABCF2). After overexpression of miR-122 in HepG2 cells treated or untreated
with doxorubicin doses, total RNAs and protein extracts were isolated for
application of QRT-PCR and western blotting techniques. Moreover, cell cycle
distribution was monitored by flow cytometry. Our results revealed that, the over
expression of miR-122 in HepG2 cells treated or untreated with doxorubicin could 
modulate the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutic drug through downregulation
of MDR-related genes, ABCB1 and ABCF2. Interpretation of cell cycle distribution 
revealed that, the anti-proliferative effect of miR-122 is associated with the
accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, treatment with miR-122 and
doxorubicin resulted in high percentage of HCC cells in G0/G1 phase. Taken
together, our findings revealed that, overexpression of miR-122 inhibited HCC
cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and this arrest is associated with
down-regulation of MDR-related genes.

Canine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary hepatic tumour
in dogs. MicroRNA (miRNA) dysregulation has been reported in human HCC and shown 
to have diagnostic and prognostic value; however, there are no data on miRNA
expression in canine HCC. The aim of the present study was to investigate
differentially expressed miRNAs in canine HCC. Analysis of miRNA expression in
canine HCC tissues and cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription PCR
showed that miR-1, miR-122, let-7a, and let-7g were downregulated, whereas
miR-10b and miR-21 were upregulated in canine HCC. MET is one of the target genes
of miR-1. MET was upregulated in canine HCC at the gene and protein levels, and a
significant correlation between the concomitant downregulation of miR-1 and
upregulation of MET was observed. Fast/intermediate-proliferating canine HCC cell
lines had higher MET gene and protein expression levels than the
slow-proliferating cell line. These findings suggest that miRNAs are
differentially expressed in canine HCC, and that the miR-1/MET pathway may be
associated with canine HCC cell proliferation.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common cancers worldwide with highest incidence in Asia and Africa. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs), a class of non-coding single stranded RNA, which not only post
transcriptionally regulate gene expression but also respond to signaling
molecules to affect cell functions such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling specifically
in HCC. The goal of this study is to investigate the crosstalk between
Wnt/β-catenin signaling proteins and microRNAs expression in HCC patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh tissue samples of 30 primary HCC patients and 10
control subjects were included. Expression level of 13 different miRNAs (miR-10a-
miR-106b- miR-99a- miR-148a- miR-125b- miR-30e- miR-183- miR-155- miR-199a-
miR-199a3p- miR-24- miR-122 and miR-215) were examined using real-time PCR assay.
Five proteins involved in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (β-catenin, APC, c-myc,
survivin and cyclin D1) were analysed by immunohistochemistry technique. The
correlation between miRNAs expression levels with protein expressions was
assessed.
RESULTS: Up-regulation of miR-155 and miR-183 was reported in HCC patients
compared to normal controls and this up-regulation was significantly correlated
with liver cirrhosis in the case of miR-155 (p<0.05) referring to their oncogenic
activity. Down-regulation was observed for 11 miRNAs in HCC indicating their
tumour suppression activity. MiRNA-10a, miR-30e, miR-215, miR-125b and miR-148a
were significantly correlated with the expression of important players in
Wnt/β-catenin pathway including β-catenin, APC and c-myc (p<0.05). Detailed
analysis revealed that miR-215 is associated with the grade of the disease and
miR-125b is associated with HCV infection.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data showed potential role of miR-10a, miR-30e,
miR-215, miR-125b and miR-148a as important mediators in HCC progression.
Furthermore, their association with Wnt/β-catenin cascade proteins could be
exploited to develop new therapeutic target strategies in HCC.

BACKGROUND: Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is an important risk factor 
of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Type 1 interferon (IFN)
signaling-related miRNAs were significantly associated with hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection. However, the characteristics of serum IFN signaling-related
miRNAs in OBI remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the
expression levels of serum IFN signaling-related miRNAs in OBI and to evaluate
their potential values for OBI diagnosis.
METHODS: Twenty serum samples for training test (10 healthy controls and 10 OBI
patients) and 438 validation serum samples from healthy controls, asymptomatic
HBsAg carriers (ASC), and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and OBI patients were
collected. Expression levels of 32 IFN signaling-related miRNAs were analyzed in 
training and validation sets of samples using RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: Among 32 IFN signaling-related miRNAs, decreased miR-122 levels and
increased miR-130a levels were detected in training OBI samples. Furthermore, the
results from validation test showed that the mean serum miR-122 and miR-130a
level was 2.28 ± 0.96 and 3.11 ± 0.93 in OBI subjects, respectively. Compared to 
the healthy controls, ASC and CHB patients, miR-122 levels were significantly
downregulated, while miR-130a levels were significantly upregulated in OBI
patients. ROC analysis indicated that miR-122 + miR-130a could differentiate OBI 
from healthy controls, ASC, and CHB (≥ 0.87 of AUC).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that decreased serum miR-122 level and increased
miR-130a level were significantly associated with OBI. Moreover, a combination of
miR-122 and miR-130a could be served as a potential marker for OBI diagnosis.

The downregulation of microRNA-122 (miR-122) had been reported to be associated
with tumor invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However,
the underlying mechanisms of miR-122 involved in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) still need to be investigated. In the study, we demonstrated
that miR-122 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with
adjacent normal tissues. MiR-122 expression was closely correlated with tumor
size, vascular invasion and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage of
HCC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log rank test demonstrated that
lower miR-122 predicted poor Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival
(OS) time in patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis confirmed that
tumor size, vascular invasion, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage
and lower miR-122 expression levels were independent risk factors for DFS or OS
in HCC patients. Function assays demonstrated that upregulation of miR-122
inhibited the cell proliferation, colony formation and cell invasion in HCC
cells, however, downregulation of miR-122 promoted cell proliferation, colony
formation and cell invasion in HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that
increased miR-122 expression levels in HCC cells inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) by suppressing the expression of ZEB1/2, Snail1/2, N-cadherin,
Vimentin and upregulating the E-cadherin expression. However, downregulation of
miR-122 caused an opposite effects. Mechanisms study found that miR-122
overexpression inhibited the EMT process by targeting Snail1 and Snail2 and
regulated their expression levels in HCC cells. In addition, we also revealed
that upregulated miR-122 expression suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-122 may be a biomarker
for predicting prognosis of HCC and therapeutic target for HCC patients.

Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can significantly improve the
overall survival of HCC patients. However, current diagnostic markers are
compromised and limited by their low sensitivity and specificity. In this work,
circulating microRNAs (miRs) were utilized as a diagnostic tool to test their
efficiency to segregate HCC and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients from
healthy subjects. Nine HCC-related miRs (miR-21, miR-30c, miR-93, miR-122,
miR-125b, miR-126, miR-130a, miR-193b and miR-222) were analyzed by Real-Time PCR
in 86 serum samples; 34 HCC and 52 HCV patients in addition to 25 healthy
subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of these miRs were assessed. Our
results demonstrated that the median serum level of seven miRs was significantly 
reduced (P ranges from <0.01 to<0.001) in HCC patients whereas nine miRs were
reduced (P<0.001) in HCV compared to healthy controls. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analyses had shown high diagnostic accuracy (AUC=1.0) 
when seven and nine combined miRs were considered in HCC and HCV groups,
respectively compared to their counterparts. However, a combination of
differentially expressed miRs did not improve the discriminatory power
(AUC=0.742) when HCC compared to non-HCC groups. miR-122 showed the highest
sensitivity and specificity to stratify HCC and HCV versus normal individuals and
HCC versus HCV patients. We conclude that differentially expressed miRs in the
serum of HCV and HCC patients can be utilized as surrogate and non-invasive
biomarker for segregation of HCV and HCC patients from healthy subjects.

MicroRNA-122, an abundant and conserved liver-specific miRNA, regulates hepatic
metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor, yet systematic and direct
biochemical elucidation of the miR-122 target network remains incomplete. To this
end, we performed Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (Argonaute
[Ago]-CLIP) sequencing in miR-122 knockout and control mouse livers, as well as
in matched human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver tissue to
identify miRNA target sites transcriptome-wide in two species. We observed
a majority of miR-122 binding on 3' UTRs and coding exons followed by extensive
binding to other genic and non-genic sites. Motif analysis of miR-122-dependent
binding revealed a G-bulged motif in addition to canonical motifs. A large number
of miR-122 targets were found to be species specific. Upregulation of several
common mouse and human targets, most notably BCL9, predicted survival in HCC
patients. These results broadly define the molecular consequences of miR-122
downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: In Egypt, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection is
13.8% of whole population and about 80% of the patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma have underling hepatitis C.
AIM: This study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of plasma miR-122 and
miR-21 in patients with CHC, genotype-4, to detect fibrosis progression versus
noninvasive indices and their diagnostic value in detection of early stages of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODOLOGY: A prospective study that included 180 patients, divided into 3
groups: healthy controls (group I), CHC patients (group II), and hepatitis C
patients with HCC (group III); all cases were subjected to thorough clinical,
radiological, and laboratory investigations. Selected biomarkers were evaluated
and correlated with degree of liver damage. Results revealed that miR-122
followed by miR-21 had the highest efficiency in prediction of liver cell damage.
Also, miR-21 was strongly correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and alpha fetoprotein (α-FP) in HCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma miR-122 and miR-21 had strong correlation with degree
fibrosis in HCV genotype-4 patients; consequently they can be considered as
potential biomarker for early detection of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, miR-21 can
be used as a potential biomarker, for early detection of HCC combined with VEGF
and α-FP.

The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms behind the development and
progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and identify information regarding 
HCC-related microRNAs (miRNAs) or marker genes for the gene therapy of HCC. Gene 
expression profile of GSE67882, generated from 4 hepatitis B virus infected HCC
tissue samples (HCC group) and 8 chronic hepatitis B tissue samples with no
fibrosis (control group) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus
database. The differentially expressed miRNAs functional enrichment and pathway
analyses of HCC were revealed, followed by transcription factor-miRNA interaction
network construction and analyses. A total of 14 upregulated miRNAs and 16
downregulated miRNAs between HCC and control samples were obtained.
Differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly involved in biological processes like
the regulation of histone H3-K9 methylation, and the KEGG pathways in cancer
map05200 demonstrates their involvement in cancer. A total of 3 outstanding
regulatory networks of miRNAs: hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-125b and hsa-miR-122 were
revealed. A total of 11 differentially expressed miRNAs including hsa-miR-146p-5b
that regulated the marker genes of HCC were explored. miRNAs such as hsa-miR-15a,
hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-122 and hsa-miR-146b-5p may be new biomarkers for the gene 
therapy of HCC. Furthermore, histone H3-K9 methylation and other pathways in
cancer observed in the KEGG map05200 may be closely related with the development 
of HCC.

AIM: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common outcome of chronic hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection and constitutes the main burden of this disease. The
molecular mechanisms underlying the development of HCC are multiple and might
involve certain microRNA (miR). As discordant results have been reported
concerning the detection of expression of miR-152 and miR-122 in HCC, our aim was
to measure the levels of both miRs in serum and liver samples.
METHODS: We analyzed miR-152 and miR-122 expression by reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a serum cohort from 14
HCV-infected patients who developed HCC, 20 HCV+ patients without HCC, and 19
control patients. We also studied miR-152 and miR-122 in an independent tissue
cohort from 11 normal livers, and from paired HCC and non-tumor adjacent livers
of 11 HCV-infected patients and 12 non-infected patients.
RESULTS: In serum samples, higher levels of miR-122 were found in non-HCC HCV+
compared to HCC HCV+ and control groups, whereas miR-152 was detectable in a
lower range in HCC HCV+ compared to non-HCC HCV+ and control groups. We found
higher signals for miR-122 and miR-152 in non-tumor liver and HCC tissues
compared to control tissues. Hepatocellular carcinoma etiology had no detectable 
influence on miR-122 expression, whereas miR-152 was increased in HCV+ tissue
samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of low values of circulating miR-152 is a potentially
interesting marker of hepatocarcinogenesis in HCV+ patients, in contrast to
miR-122, which varies according to hepatocyte damage.

Reduced microRNA (miR)‑122 expression levels are frequently observed in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study was conducted to investigate
potential targets of miR‑122 and determine the underlying regulatory mechanisms
of miR‑122 in HCC development. The public dataset GSE31731 was utilized,
consisting of 8 miR‑122 knockout (KO) mice (miR‑122 KO) and 8 age‑matched
wild‑type mice (WT group). Following data preprocessing, the differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) were selected, followed by enrichment analysis. A
protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was established, and a module network
was further extracted. Combining the DEGs with microRNA targeting databases
permitted the screening of the overlapping targets of miR‑122. Furthermore,
previously reported genes were screened out by literature mining. Transcription
factors (TFs) of the targets were subsequently investigated. DEGs between miR‑122
KO and WT groups were selected, including 713 upregulated and 395 downregulated
genes. Of these, upregulated genes were enriched in cell cycle‑associated
processes [including nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 (NUSAP1)], the
cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction pathway [including C‑X‑C motif chemokine
receptor 4 (CXCR4) and C‑C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)], and the
extracellular matrix‑receptor interaction pathway [including integrin subunit
alpha V (ITGAV)]. In addition, multiple overlapping targets were highlighted in
the PPI network, including NUSAP1, CXCR4, CCR2 and ITGAV. Notably, CXCR4 and CCR2
were linked in module C, enriched in the cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction
pathway. Furthermore, upregulated sex determining region Y‑box 4 (SOX4) was
identified as a TF. The results of the present study may provide a theoretical
basis for further studies on the mechanisms of miR‑122 in the development of HCC.

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miR) participate in cell proliferation, apoptosis and
transformation, as they can regulate gene expression and intracellular signal
transduction for various physiological processes. MiR-122 and miR-22 are known to
be related with occurrence and progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related
hepatocellular cancer (HCC). This study recruited HBV-related HCC patients, whose
expression levels of miR-122 and miR-22 were determined to analyze the
correlation with clinical and pathological indexes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: HBV-related HCC patients were enrolled, in parallel with
patients suffering from benign liver disease and non-HBV-related HCC. Real-time
PCR was employed to measure miR-122 and miR-22 expression levels.
RESULTS: The relative expression levels of miR-122 and miR-22 in HBV-related HCC 
patients were 1.26 ± 2.73 and 5.49 ± 3.91, respectively, which were significantly
lower than that in benign liver disease or non-HBV-related HCC patients (p <
0.05). No significant difference of serum miR-122 or miR-22 levels was found
between benign liver disease and non-HBV-related HCC patients (p > 0.05). The
miR-122 and miR-22 levels were negatively correlated with tumor size, lymph node 
metastasis, TNM stage, pathological type, differentiation grade, liver cirrhosis,
AFP and HBV DNA, all of which were independent risk factors (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-122 and miR-22 were downregulated in HBV-related HCC patients,
and were related with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, pathological 
type, differentiation grade, liver cirrhosis, AFP and HBV DNA.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of the
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), astragaloside IV (AS-IV) and curcumin on
tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic nude-mouse model of human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have previously shown the usefulness of
orthotopic models of human cancer for evaluation of the efficacy of TCM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nude mice with orthotopic HepG2 HCC were treated with
vehicle control (0.01 ml/g normal saline), cisplatinum (2 mg/kg), AS-IV (20
mg/kg), curcumin (100 mg/kg) or AS-IV plus curcumin (20 mg/kg + 100 mg/kg). Tumor
inhibition in each group was evaluated by tumor weight at autopsy. The effect of 
AS-IV and curcumin on tumor angiogenesis was assessed by CD34 staining and
expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), matrix metalloproteinase 2
(MMP2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), thrombosis-related factor tissue factor (TF) and coagulation factor VII
(FVII), as well as microRNAs miR-122 and miR-221.
RESULTS: AS-IV and curcumin alone and in combination significantly reduced mean
tumor weight compared to vehicle control (p<0.05). Tumor microvessel count was
reduced by AS-IV and curcumin alone. Expression of FGF2, MMP2, VEGF, HGF, TF and 
FVII was reduced by AS-IV and curcumin alone. AS-IV and curcumin alone
up-regulated expression of miR-122 and down-regulated that of miR-221. The
combination of AS-IV and curcumin demonstrated significant synergistic effects on
microvessel count as well as on expression of angiogenic and thrombosis-related
factors and microRNAs.
CONCLUSION: The present study indicates future clinical potential of combination 
therapy with AS-IV and curcumin for HCC.

BACKGROUND: The association between circulating microRNA-122 (miR-122) and
histopathological features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains
unclear.
METHODS: The association of serum miR-122 levels with histopathological features 
of NAFLD (steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, and stage, as histological
components of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) was examined in serial liver biopsies
from 36 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-free Japanese patients with
histopathologically-proven NAFLD. The median interval between first and second
liver biopsies was 4.6 years.
RESULTS: In patients who showed improvement of histopathological scores
(steatosis, ballooning, and stage), serum miR-122 levels were significantly lower
at second biopsy than first biopsy. In patients who showed no improvement, the
changes at second biopsy were not different from those at first biopsy. There
were significant and strong associations between serum miR-122 ratio (ratio of
level at second biopsy to that at first biopsy) and changes in histopathological 
scores (of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and stage). There were also
significant and strong associations between serum miR-122 ratio and changes in
other clinical parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal examination of serial liver biopsies showed the
association of serum miR-122 with histopathological features of HCC-free NAFLD
patients.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is liver specific and plays an important role in
physiology as well as diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Downregulation of miR-122 in HCC modulates apoptosis. Similarly, the putative
targets of miR-122, the forkhead box (FOX) family genes also play an important
role in the regulation of apoptosis. Hence, an interplay between miR-122 and FOX 
family genes has been explored in this study. Initially, an augmentation of
apoptosis was noticed in HepG2 cells after transfection with miR-122. Further,
the predicted miR-122 targets, the FOX family genes ( FOXM1b, FOXP1, and FOXO4)
were selected via in silico analysis based on their role in apoptosis. We checked
the expression of all these genes at transcript level after the transfection of
miR-122 and found that the relative expression of FOXP1 and FOXM1b was
significantly downregulated (p < 0.005) and that of FOXO4 was upregulated
(p < 0.005). Thus, the finding indicates deregulation of these FOX genes as a
result of miR-122 augmentation might be involved in the modulation of apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: Current biochemical indicators cannot discriminate between
parenchymal, biliary, vascular, and neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases. MicroRNAs 
are promising new biomarkers for hepatobiliary disease in humans and dogs.
OBJECTIVE: To measure serum concentrations of an established group of microRNAs
in dogs and to investigate their concentrations in various types of hepatobiliary
diseases.
ANIMALS: Forty-six client-owned dogs with an established diagnosis of
hepatobiliary disease and stored serum samples and eleven client-owned healthy
control Labrador Retrievers.
METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records of dogs with parenchymal, biliary, 
vascular, or neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases and control dogs were reviewed.
Concentrations of miR-21, miR-122, miR-126, miR-148a, miR-200c, and miR-222 were 
quantified in serum by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: No different microRNA concentrations were found in the adenoma and
congenital portosystemic shunt groups. In all other diseases, miR-122
concentrations were elevated with the highest concentration in the mucocele group
(267-fold, CI: 40-1,768, P < .001). In dogs with biliary diseases, miR-21 and
miR-222 were only increased in dogs with mucoceles (26-fold, CI: 5-141, P = .005 
and 13-fold, CI: 2-70, P = .025, respectively). Uniquely increased microRNAs were
found in the hepatocellular carcinoma group (miR-200c, 35-fold increase, CI:
3-382, P = .035) and the chronic hepatitis group (miR-126, 22-fold increase, CI: 
5-91, P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A microRNA panel consisting of miR-21,
miR-122, miR-126, miR-200c, and miR-222 can distinguish between parenchymal,
biliary, and neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases. Serum microRNA profiling is a
promising new tool that might be a valuable addition to conventional diagnostics 
to help diagnose various hepatobiliary diseases in dogs.

The identification of new high-sensitivity and high-specificity markers for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential. We aimed at identifying serum
microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for early detection of HCC on top
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We investigated serum expression of 13 miRNAs 
in 384 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease (192 with HCC, 96 with
liver cirrhosis (LC), and 96 with chronic hepatitis C (CHC)) in addition to 96
healthy participants enrolled as a control group. The miRNA expression was
performed using real-time quantitative PCR-based SYBR Green custom miRNA arrays. 
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to
evaluate the diagnostic performance of miRNA panels for early detection of HCC.
Using miRNA panel of miR-122, miR-885-5p, and miR-29b with alpha fetoprotein
(AFP) provided high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 1) for early detection of HCC in
normal population while using miRNA panel of miR-122, miR-885-5p, miR-221, and
miR-22 with AFP provided high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.982) for early
detection of HCC in LC patients. However, using miRNA panel of miR-22 and
miR-199a-3p with AFP provided high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.988) for early
detection of HCC in CHC patients. We identified serum miRNA panels that could
have a considerable clinical use in early detection of HCC in both normal
population and high-risk patients.

Comment in
    Hepatology. 2016 Nov;64(5):1424-1426.

The tumor suppressor p53 is a central regulator of signaling pathways that
controls the cell cycle and maintains the integrity of the human genome. p53
level is regulated by mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2), which marks p53 for
proteasomal degradation. The p53-Mdm2 circuitry is subjected to complex
regulation by a variety of mechanisms, including microRNAs (miRNAs). We found a
novel effector of this regulatory circuit, namely, miR-122*, the passenger strand
of the abundantly expressed liver-specific miR-122. Here, we demonstrate that
miR-122* levels are reduced in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found
that miR-122* targets Mdm2, thus participating as an important player in the
p53-Mdm2 circuitry. Moreover, we observed significant negative correlation
between levels of miR-122* and Mdm2 in a large set of human HCC samples. In vivo 
tumorigenicity assays demonstrate that miR-122* is capable of inhibiting tumor
growth, emphasizing the tumor-suppressor characteristics of this miRNA.
Furthermore, we show that blocking miR-122 in murine livers with an antagomiR-122
(miRNA inhibitor) results in miR-122* accumulation, leading to Mdm2 repression
followed by elevated p53 protein levels.CONCLUSION: miR-122*, the passenger
strand of miR-122, regulates the activity of p53 by targeting Mdm2. Importantly, 
similarly to miR-122, miR-122* is significantly down-regulated in human HCC. We
therefore propose that miR-122* is an important contributor to the tumor
suppression activity previously attributed solely to miR-122. (Hepatology

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an invasive form of hepatic cancer arising from
the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. In this study, the causal role 
of disturbed canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway was approved, and some of HCC-driven
important gene candidates were determined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding
RNAs, are the key regulators of important cancer genes, and their participation
in tumorigenesis has been shown. By reviewing literature, WNT1 gene with
functional significance was selected to approve miRNAs as new subjects for
targeted therapy.For proper and fast miRNA detection and also confirmation of the
role of bioinformatics in obtaining practical data, we benefited from different
bioinformatics tools such as TargetScan, miRanda, and DIANA. In order to use an
HCC model, we used HepG2 cell line. Luciferase assay was applied to assess the
ability of the selected miRNAs in targeting WNT1 3'-UTR. To overexpress the
selected miRNA in HepG2 cell line, viral construct was prepared. Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed to evaluate selected miRNA and target gene expression
levels. miR-122 was selected according to data concerning various bioinformatics 
tools.miR-122 was downregulated and WNT1 gene expression was upregulated in HepG2
cell line. After viral construct transduction, miR-122 expression was elevated
and WNT1 expression was notably declined. Finally, we introduced WNT1 gene as one
of the important genes in HCC, and also, we showed that miR-122 can regulate WNT1
gene expression.Moreover, our study determines the potential of bioinformatics
analyses in providing accurate and reliable data for miRNA: messenger RNA (mRNA) 
prediction.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most deadly form of liver
cancer. Chronic hepatitis and subsequent liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are the
major causes of HCC. HBV infection results not only in HCC but also extra-hepatic
cancers. However, the importance and approaches for HCC screening in HBV infected
individuals, the risk factors of HCC, the possible mechanisms leading to HCC and 
the potential therapeutic approaches of HBV-related HCC have less been systematic
reviewed.
METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the screening, risk, new biomarker, mechanism
and therapeutic of HBV-related HCC.
RESULTS: Serum AFP should be used for the HCC screening in CHB patients. Higher
HBV viral load is associated with increased risk of HCC. HBV genotype and genetic
polymorphism contribute to the risk of HCC.Ku86, Ku86 antibody, miR-18a, miR-122 
and miR-150 may be reliable markers of HBVrelated HCC. MicroRNAs and HBx play a
key role in HBV-related HCC. Two types of drugs, conventional interferon (IFN),
and nucleoside analogs (NAs), have recently become available for the treatment of
CHB infection. However, treatment guidelines for these patients have not yet
established.
CONCLUSION: A comprehensive understanding of how HBV infection causes HCC is of
great importance in developing more effective antiviral therapy and prevention of
late stage consequences such as cirrhosis and HCC. Regular screening in HBV
infected individuals is a practically useful approach in reducing the HCC
incidence in these patients. More reliable markers for HCC early detection should
be explored. Combining IFNs and NAs with other curative approaches have superior 
benefits in preventing HCC recurrence.

Drug resistance is one of the main hurdles for the successful treatment of
hepatic carcinoma. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying resistance remain 
largely unknown and therapeutic approaches are limited. In the present study, we 
show that miR-122 confers resistance to 5-fluorouracil induced hepatocellular
carcinoma cell apoptosis in vitro and reduces the potency of 5-fluorouracil in
the inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. Further
studies indicate that miR-122 modulates drug resistance through down-regulation
of expression of PCDH20, which belongs to the protocadherin gene family and
negatively regulates Akt activation. Knockdown of PCDH20 expression increases Akt
phosphorylation, which leads to elevated mTOR activity and enhanced
5-fluorouracil resistance; whereas rescue of PCDH20 expression in
miR-122-expressing cells decreases Akt and mTOR phosphorylation, re-sensitizing
hepatocellular carcinoma cell to 5-fluorouracil induced apoptosis. Moreover, a
specific and potent Akt inhibitor reverses miR-122-conferred 5-fluorouracil
resistance. These findings indicate that the miR-122/PCDH20/Akt/mTOR signaling
axis has an important role in mediating response to chemotherapy in human
hepatocellular carcinoma. A major implication of our study is that inhibition of 
miR-122 or restoration of PCDH20 expression may have significant therapeutic
potential to overcome drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma and that the
combined use of an Akt inhibitor with 5-fluorouracil may increase efficacy in
liver cancer treatment.

Current treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown inadequate.
MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) mediated RNA interference brings new prospects. A safe,
efficient miRNA delivery system is an indispensable assurance. Previously, we
developed an MS2 bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP)-based microRNA delivery 
system crosslinked with the HIV TAT peptide, which served as an effective
inhibitor in the treatments of systemic lupus erythematosus and osteoporosis.
However, defects, such as low crosslinking efficiency, high cost, and potential
toxicity of the crosslinking agent, needed to be confronted. Therefore, TAT
peptide was designed to display on the surface of MS2 VLPs, instead of being
chemically crosslinked, using the platform of phage surface display. The results 
reflected that MS2 VLPs displaying TAT could effectively penetrate the
cytomembrane and deliver miR-122. Additionally, its inhibitory effects on HCC
were significant in Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7 cells and Hep3B related animal models.
Thus, we have established a novel miR-122 delivery system based on MS2 VLPs
surface displaying TAT peptide, which could effectively perform the function of
penetrating cytomembrane and the inhibition of HCC.

A hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell culture system incorporating the JFH-1 strain and 
the human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 enabled the production of infectious HCV
particles. Several host factors were identified as essential for HCV replication.
Supplementation of these factors in nonhepatic human cell lines enabled HCV
replication and particle production. Vero cells established from monkey kidney
are commonly used for the production of vaccines against a variety of viruses. In
this study, we aimed to establish a novel Vero cell line to reconstruct the HCV
life cycle. Unmodified Vero cells did not allow HCV infection or replication. The
expression of microRNA 122 (miR-122), an essential factor for HCV replication, is
notably low in Vero cells. Therefore, we supplemented Vero cells with miR-122 and
found that HCV replication was enhanced. However, Vero cells that expressed
miR-122 still did not allow HCV infection. We supplemented HCV receptor molecules
and found that scavenger receptor class B type I (SRBI) was essential for HCV
infection in Vero cells. The supplementation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a host
factor important for virus production, enabled the production of infectious virus
in Vero cells. Finally, we created a Vero cell line that expressed the essential 
factors miR-122, SRBI, and ApoE; the entire HCV life cycle, including infection, 
replication, and infectious virus production, was completed in these cells. In
conclusion, we demonstrated that miR-122, SRBI, and ApoE were necessary and
sufficient for the completion of the entire HCV life cycle in nonhuman,
nonhepatic Vero cells.IMPORTANCE: HCV is a major cause of chronic liver diseases 
worldwide, and an effective prophylactic HCV vaccine is needed. For safety
reasons, the current HCV cell culture system using HuH-7 cells, which was
established from a hepatocellular carcinoma, is not suitable for the production
of a vaccine against HCV. A robust HCV production system using non-cancer-derived
cells is indispensable for this purpose. In this study, we wanted to establish a 
novel HCV cell culture system using Vero cells, which are widely used in the
production of vaccines against different viruses. We identified the minimum
essential host factors for the completion of the entire HCV life cycle in Vero
cells to develop a novel HCV cell culture system. A cell culture system that uses
Vero cells will be useful not only for HCV vaccine production but also for the
further elucidation of the mechanisms of various HCV-host interactions.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been repeatedly shown to play important roles
in liver pathologies, including hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer.
Egypt has the highest hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection rate worldwide,
predominantly involving genotype-4.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, we attempted to characterize the miRNA profile of the 
poorly studied genotype 4 of HCV in chronically infected Egyptian patients to
obtain a better understanding of the disease and its complications and help in
the design of better management protocols.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression levels of a selected panel of 94
miRNAs in fresh liver biopsies collected from 50 Egyptian patients diagnosed with
chronic HCV infection using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) assay. Non-parametric tests were used to analyze the expression level of
each miRNA and association with the clinicopathological features of enrolled
patients in this study.
RESULTS: Our results revealed differential expression levels of the analyzed
miRNAs compared to the normal controls. Twenty-seven miRNAs (including miR-105,
miR-147, miR-149-3p, and miR-196b) showed up-regulation, while 17 miRNAs
(including miR-21, miR-122, miR-199a-3p, and miR-223) showed down-regulation. An 
inverse correlation was observed between levels of miR-95, miR-130a, and
miR-142-5p with the blood albumin level. Increased expression levels of seven
miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-30c, miR-126, miR-145, miR-199a, miR-199a-3p, and miR-222)
were observed with severe chronic hepatic inflammation. Several deregulated
miRNAs found in this study have been previously linked to chronic liver
inflammation and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified expression profiles of some examined miRNAs might
offer important points to consider for the treatment of naive patients and the
management of chronically infected HCV patients in Egypt and around the world.

METHODS: We included 177 HCC patients treated with TACE in the study; TACE
refractoriness and liver transplantation-free survival were evaluated during
follow up. Pretreatment plasma miR-122 levels were assessed using quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction. Relative quantification of miR-122
expression (fold change) was determined using the 2(-ΔΔCt) method. MiR-16 was
used as an internal control for the normalization of miRNA data.
RESULTS: During the mean follow up of 22.4 (range, 1-79) months, 112 (69.5%)
patients exhibited TACE refractoriness. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor
number (hazard ratio [HR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-4.41;
P = 0.001) and tumor size (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.62-4.32; P = 0.000) can
independently predict overall TACE refractoriness. High miR-122 expression
(> 100) was associated with early TACE refractoriness (within 1 year; HR, 2.77;
95% CI, 1.12-6.86; P = 0.028), together with tumor number (HR, 22.73; 95% CI,
2.74-188.66; P = 0.004) and tumor size (HR, 4.90; 95% CI, 1.99-12.06; P = 0.001).
Univariate analyses showed that high miR-122 expression tends to be associated
with poor liver transplantation-free survival (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.95-2.11;
P = 0.085). However, it was statistically insignificant in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: High expression levels of plasma miR-122 are associated with early
TACE refractoriness in HCC patients treated with TACE.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) is a type of oncogenic
protein involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via
interacting with host genes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been
observed in HCC. This study aimed to investigate the role of HBx protein in the
regulation of miR-19a, miR-122 and miR-223, and examine if these miRNAs involve
in progression of malignant hepatocytes.
METHODS: Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression 
of miR-19a, miR-122 and miR-223 in patient samples and in HepG2 cells transfected
with HBx or 1.3 fold HBV genome and also in HepG2.2.15 cells, which stably
produces HBV. Their target mRNAs and proteins-PTEN, cyclin G1 and c-myc were
measured by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The effect of miR-19a,
miR-122 and miR-223, and their respective target genes, on cell proliferation was
analyzed using 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation and MTT assay.
RESULTS: MiR-19a showed an up-regulation in HBV-positive HCC patients compared to
healthy controls and HBV-negative HCC patients, while miR-122 and miR-223 showed 
a down-regulation compared to healthy controls, and miR-122 in HBV-positive HCC
patients was also down-regulated when compared to HBV-negative HCC patients.
MiR-19a was found to be up-regulated in HepG2 cells transfected with HBx or 1.3
fold HBV genome, but down-regulated in HepG2.2.15 cells. MiR-122 and miR-223 were
down-regulated in HBx or 1.3 fold HBV transfected HepG2 cells as well as in
HepG2.2.15 cell. Their target mRNAs and corresponding proteins-PTEN was
down-regulated, while cyclin G1 and c-myc were found to be up-regulated.
Modulated expression of miR-19a, miR-122 and miR-223 enhanced cell proliferation 
of HBx-transfected HepG2 cells, and rescue experiment further showed that their
target genes-PTEN, cyclin G1and c-myc involved in cell proliferation of
HBx-transfected HepG2 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-19a, miR-122 and miR-223 were differentially
regulated by HBx protein, the differential expression of miR-19a, miR-122 and
miR-223 plays an important role in cell proliferation of HCC. This study provides
new insight into understanding how HBx protein interacts with miRNAs and
subsequently regulates host function.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of microRNA-122 (miR-122) on proliferation,
migration, and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by
activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways.
METHODS: miR-122 mimics, miR-122 inhibitors, relevant control oligonucleotides,
and Wnt1 were transfected into HepG2 and huh7 cell lines which were then divided 
into six groups: miR-122 group, anti-miR-122 group, miR-negative control (NC)
group, anti-miR-NC group, miR-122 + Wnt1 group, and miR-122 + vector group. The
miR-122 expressions and mRNA expressions of Wnt1 and EMT-related genes
(E-cadherin, vimentin, β-cadherin, and N-cadherin) were quantified by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Protein expression
levels of Wnt1, E-cadherin, vimentin, β-cadherin, and N-cadherin were measured by
Western blot. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay,
wound-healing assay, and Transwell assay, respectively.
RESULTS: Dual luciferase reporter gene results showed that Wnt1 is a direct
target gene of miR-122 in both HepG2 and huh7 cell lines. Compared to miR-NC,
anti-miR-NC, and miR-122 + Wnt1 groups, miR-122 expression was markedly higher in
the miR-122 group and miR-122 + vector group, but was sharply decreased in
anti-miR-122 group (both P<0.05), and the mRNA and protein levels of Wnt1,
vimentin, β-cadherin, and N-cadherin decreased significantly; also E-cadherin
increased, and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion decreased in the
miR-122 group and miR-122 + vector group (all P<0.05), but the situation was
totally reversed in the anti-miR-122 group (all P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Downregulation of miR-122 promoted proliferation, migration, and
invasion of human HCC cells by targeting Wnt1 and regulating Wnt/β-catenin
pathway which activated the EMT pathways.

Aim of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge about the
potential relationship between miRNAs and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-hepatitis C
virus (HCV) related liver diseases. A systematic computer-based search of
published articles, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analysis Statement, was performed to identify relevant studies
on usefulness of serum/plasma/urine miRNAs, as noninvasive biomarkers for early
detection of HBV and HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, as
well as for its prognostic evaluation. The used Medical Subject Headings terms
and keywords were: "HBV", "HCV", "hepatocellular carcinoma", "microRNAs",
"miRNAs", "diagnosis", "prognosis", "therapy", "treatment". Some serum/plasma
miRNAs, including miR-21, miR-122, mi-125a/b, miR-199a/b, miR-221, miR-222,
miR-223, miR-224 might serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis/prognosis of HCC, 
but, to date, not definitive results or well-defined panels of miRNAs have been
obtained. More well-designed studies, focusing on populations of different
geographical areas and involving larger series of patients, should be carried out
to improve our knowledge on the potential role of miRNAs for HCC early detection 
and prognosis.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Relationships between circulating microRNA-122 (miR-122) and 
histological features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear.
METHODS: The impact of serum miR-122 levels for histological features and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated in 305 Japanese patients with
histological proven NAFLD. Twenty-three patients were with HCC at the time of
diagnosis of NAFLD, and four patients developed HCC during the follow-up. The
cross-sectional or longitudinal evaluations were performed to investigate the
impact for HCC.
RESULTS: Serum miR-122 levels (calibrated relative to the median levels of
patients) partly affected severity of steatosis, ballooning, lobular
inflammation, and stage. Multivariate analysis identified HCC and/or histological
components of NASH as morphological factors that independently influenced serum
miR-122 levels at the diagnosis of NAFLD. There was a strong correlation between 
serum miR-122 levels and AST, ALT levels. In cross-sectional evaluation, serum
miR-122 levels of patients without HCC were significantly higher than those with 
HCC in patients of stage 3 but not stage 4. In longitudinal evaluation of one
patient with follow-up time of 25 years, from the diagnosis of NAFLD until HCC,
serum miR-122 levels had already tended to decrease before the progression of
fibrosis stage.
CONCLUSIONS: HCC and/or histological components of NASH affected serum miR-122
levels, independently. In longitudinal evaluation of HCC patients, serum miR-122 
levels had already tended to decrease before the progression of fibrosis stage.
Further prospective studies are needed to investigate the impact of serum miR-122
for histological features and hepatocarcinogenesis of NAFLD.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene expression regulators which
expression is frequently altered in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). β-ionone (βI)
is noted for its ability to inhibit persistent preneoplastic lesions (pPNLs) in
liver rats. We evaluated the expression of miRNAs involved in carcinogenesis and 
possible targets modulated by βI, in pPNLs and surrounding of microdissected
tissues. Rats subjected to resistant hepatocyte model were treated during
promotion stage with βI (16 mg/100 g body weight) or corn oil (CO; 0.25 mL/100 g 
body weight; controls). Five animals receive no treatment (NT). In CO group, 38
and 29 miRNAs showed reduced expression relative to NT (P < 0.05) in pPNLs and
surrounding, respectively. No miRNAs showed increased expression in surrounding
of the CO compared to NT group; however, 30 miRNAs showed increased expression
(P ≤ 0.05) in pPNLs of the CO group. There was no difference between βI and CO
groups (P > 0.05) in the expression of miRNAs in surrounding. In pPNLs βI
increased expression of miR-122 and miR-34a (P ≤ 0.05) and reduced of Igf2
(P ≤ 0.05), target of the latter, compared to CO. Additionally, βI decreased the 
expression of miR-181c and its target Gdf2 (P ≤ 0.05). βI reduced the expression 
of miR-181b and miR-708 (P ≤ 0.05) and increased the expression of their
respective target mRNAs Timp3 and Mtss1 (P ≤ 0.05), relative to CO group.
Modulation of miRNAs target genes by βI was confirmed in vitro. βI is a promising
chemopreventive agent in the initial stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, as it
modulates the expression of the miRNAs and target genes that can alter the
metastatic phenotype of HCC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Persistent inflammation in chronic hepatitis plays a major role in the
development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the major
inflammatory cytokines expressed in chronic hepatitis, IL-6 and TNF-α, induced a 
marked decrease in microRNA-122 (miR-122) levels, and miR-122 expression was
downregulated in the livers of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The decrease
of miR-122 caused upregulation of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2. IL-6 and
TNF-α suppressed miR-122 both by directly downregulating the transcription factor
C/EBPα and indirectly upregulating c-myc, which blocks C/EBPα-mediated miR-122
transcription. In addition, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were elevated and miR-122
levels were decreased in mouse and rat models of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced
HCC. Restoration of miR-122 levels through delivery of agomir-122 suppressed
DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Our results show that
inflammation-induced miR-122 downregulation in hepatitis contributes to
carcinogenesis and suggest that increasing miR-122 may be an effective strategy
for preventing HCC development in CHB patients.

Serum levels of liver enzymes, such as alanine transaminase, aspartate
transaminase, and α-fetoprotein, provide insight into liver function and are used
during treatment of liver disease, but such information is limited. In the case
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is often not detected until an advanced 
stage, more sensitive biomarkers may help to achieve earlier detection. Serum
also contains microRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNAs that play an important 
role in regulating gene expression. miR-122 is specific to the liver and
correlates strongly with liver enzyme levels and necroinflammatory activity, and 
other microRNAs are correlated with the degree of fibrosis. miR-122 has also been
found to be required for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, whereas other
microRNAs have been shown to play antiviral roles. miR-125a-5p and miR-1231 have 
been shown to directly target hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcripts, and others are
up- or down-regulated in infected individuals. MicroRNA profiles also differ in
the case of HBV and HCV infection as well as between HBeAg-positive and negative 
patients, and in patients with occult versus active HBV infection. In such
patients, monitoring of changes in microRNA profiles might provide earlier
warning of neoplastic changes preceding HCC.

To date, studies of the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) have either focused on specific individual miRNAs and a small number of
suspected targets or simply reported a list of differentially expressed miRNAs
based on expression profiling. Here, we seek a more in-depth understanding of the
roles of miRNAs and their targets in HCC by integrating the miRNA and messenger
RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of tumorous and adjacent non-tumorous liver
tissues of 100 HCC patients. We assessed the levels of 829 mature miRNAs, of
which 32 were significantly differentially expressed. Statistical analysis
indicates that six of these miRNAs regulate a significant proportion of their in 
silico predicted target mRNAs. Three of these miRNAs (miR-26a, miR-122, and
miR-130a) were down-regulated in HCC, and their up-regulated gene targets are
primarily associated with aberrant cell proliferation that involves DNA
replication, transcription and nucleotide metabolism. The other three miRNAs
(miR-21, miR-93, and miR-221) were up-regulated in HCC, and their down-regulated 
gene targets are primarily involved in metabolism and immune system processes. We
further found evidence for a coordinated miRNA-induced regulation of important
cellular processes, a finding to be considered when designing therapeutic
applications based on miRNAs.

Mice overexpressing the longevity protein SIRT6 or deficient for the liver's most
prevalent microRNA miR-122 display a similar set of phenotypes, including
improved lipid profile and protection against damage linked to obesity. Here, we 
show that miR-122 and SIRT6 negatively regulate each other's expression. SIRT6
downregulates miR-122 by deacetylating H3K56 in the promoter region. MiR-122
binds to three sites on the SIRT6 3' UTR and reduces its levels. The interplay
between SIRT6 and miR-122 is manifested in two physiologically relevant ways in
the liver. First, they oppositely regulate a similar set of metabolic genes and
fatty acid β-oxidation. Second, in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, loss of a
negative correlation between SIRT6 and miR-122 expression is significantly
associated with better prognosis. These findings show that SIRT6 and miR-122
negatively regulate each other to control various aspects of liver physiology and
SIRT6-miR-122 correlation may serve as a biomarker for hepatocarcinoma prognosis.

Sorafenib is the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), but the clinical response to sorafenib is seriously limited by drug
resistance. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of sorafenib 
resistance in HCC cells. Our miRNA microarray data indicate that liver-specific
miR-122 expression was significantly reduced in sorafenib-resistant cells.
Overexpression of miR-122 made drug-tolerant cells sensitive to sorafenib and
induced apoptosis. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) was validated
as a target of miR-122 and was repressed by this miRNA. miR-122-induced apoptosis
was repressed by the IGF-1R activator IGFI or IGFII. Conversely, the IGF-1R
inhibitor PPP or NVP-AEW541 in combination with sorafenib significantly induced
cell apoptosis and disrupted tolerance to drugs in vitro. These results indicated
that activation of IGF-1R by ectopic down-regulation of miR-122 counteracted the 
effects of sorafenib-induced apoptosis, thus conferring sorafenib resistance.
Further study revealed that activation of IGF-1R by miR-122 down-regulation
contributed to activation of RAS/RAF/ERK signaling, which was associated with
drug resistance. Our data imply that an intimate correlation between miR-122 and 
IGF-1R abnormal expression is a critical determinant of sorafenib tolerance.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) displays high resistance to
conventional chemotherapy. Considering that microRNA-122 (miR-122) performs an
essential function to promote chemosensitivity of HCC cells, an effective
vehicle-mediated miR-122 delivery may represent a promising strategy for HCC
chemotherapy. An increasing interest is focused on the use of exosomes as
biological vehicles for microRNAs (miRNA) transfer. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
are known for their capacity to produce large amounts of exosomes. This study
aimed to determine whether adipose tissue-derived MSC (AMSC) exosomes can be used
for miR-122 delivery.
METHODS: AMSCs were transfected with a miR-122 expression plasmid. At 48 h after 
transfection, AMSC-derived exosomes (122-Exo) were harvested and added to
recipient HCC cells. Expression levels of miR-122 in AMSCs, exosomes, and HCC
cells were quantified by real-time PCR. The mRNA and protein levels of
miR-122-target genes in recipient HCC cells were quantified by real-time PCR and 
Western blot, respectively. The effects of 122-Exo on cell viability, apoptosis, 
and cell cycle of HCC cells were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometry analysis.
Xenograft models were used to determine whether 122-Exo can sensitize HCC cells
to sorafenib in vivo.
RESULTS: Data showed that miR-122-transfected AMSC can effectively package
miR-122 into secreted exosomes, which can mediate miR-122 communication between
AMSCs and HCC cells, thereby rendering cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic
agents through alteration of miR-122-target gene expression in HCC cells.
Moreover, intra-tumor injection of 122-Exo significantly increased the antitumor 
efficacy of sorafenib on HCC in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the export of miR-122 via AMSC exosomes
represents a novel strategy to enhance HCC chemosensitivity.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers have a high risk to
develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the underlying mechanism remains
unclear. Recent studies suggest that viral-human hybrid RNA transcripts, which
play a critical role in promoting HCC progression, may be the molecules
responsible for the development of HCC in HBV infected patients. Here we
determine whether HBx-LINE1, a hybrid RNA transcript of the human LINE1 and the
HBV-encoded X gene generated in tumor cells of HBV-positive HCC, can serve as a
molecular sponge for sequestering miR-122 and promoting liver cell abnormal
mitosis and mouse hepatic injury.
METHODS: Paired tumor and distal normal liver tissue specimens, as well as
HBx-LINE1 overexpressing hepatic cells, were used to test the relationship
between HBx-LINE1 and miR-122. Levels of HBx-LINE1 and miR-122 were assayed by
qRT-PCR and Northern blot. HBx-LINE1-miR-122 binding was analyzed by luciferase
reporter assay. Mouse hepatic injury was monitored by tissue staining and serum
aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin measurement.
RESULTS: HBx-LINE1 in HBV-positive HCC tissues was inversely correlated with
miR-122. Each HBx-LINE1 consists of six miR-122-binding sites, and forced
expression of HBx-LINE1 effectively depleted cellular miR-122, promoting hepatic 
cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes, including β-catenin
signaling activation, E-cadherin reduction and cell migration enhancement. Mice
administered with HBx-LINE1 display a significant mouse liver cell abnormal
mitosis and hepatic injury. However, all these effects of HBx-LINE1 are
completely abolished by miR-122.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding illustrates a previously uncharacterized
miR-122-sequestering mechanism by which HBx-LINE1 promotes hepatic cell EMT-like 
changes and mouse liver injury.

Recent studies have shown that circulating microRNAs are a potential biomarker in
various types of malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the
feasibility of using serum exosomal microRNAs as novel serological biomarkers for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We
measured the serum exosomal microRNAs and serum circulating microRNAs in patients
with CHB (n=20), liver cirrhosis (LC) (n=20) and HCC (n=20). Serum exosomal
microRNA was extracted from 500 μl of serum using an Exosome RNA Isolation kit.
The expression levels of microRNAs were quantified by real-time PCR. The
expression levels of selected microRNAs were normalized to Caenorhabditis elegans
microRNA (Cel-miR-39). The serum levels of exosomal miR-18a, miR-221, miR-222 and
miR-224 were significantly higher in patients with HCC than those with CHB or LC 
(P<0.05). Further, the serum levels of exosomal miR-101, miR-106b, miR-122 and
miR-195 were lower in patients with HCC than in patients with CHB (P=0.014,
P<0.001, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference 
in the levels of miR-21 and miR-93 among the three groups. Additionally, the
serum levels of circulating microRNAs showed a smaller difference between HCC and
either CHB or LC. This study suggests that serum exosomal microRNAs may be used
as novel serological biomarkers for HCC.

There is currently a requirement for effective treatment strategies for human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality.
MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a repressor of the endogenous apoptosis regulator Bcl‑w, 
is frequently downregulated in HCC. Thus, it is hypothesized that the activation 
of miR‑122 may induce selective hepatocellular apoptosis via caspase activation
in a model of HCC. In the present study, an miR‑122 mimic transfection was
performed in HepG2 cells, and used to investigate the role and therapeutic
potential of miR‑122 in the regulation of HCC‑derived cell lines. The apoptotic
rates of HepG2 cells were significantly increased following miR‑122 mimic
transfection. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed
that Bcl‑w mRNA was significantly reduced, while the mRNA levels of caspase‑9 and
caspase‑3 were markedly increased. The immunocytochemistry results supported the 
mRNA trends. Collectively, the present results suggest that endogenous miR‑122
contributes to HepG2 apoptosis and that transfection of mimic miR‑122 normalizes 
apoptotic levels in a model of HCC.

Novel miR-122-Mediated Effect.

The small GTPase Rab27a has been shown to control membrane trafficking and
microvesicle transport pathways, in particular the secretion of exosomes. In the 
liver, high expression of Rab27a correlates with the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma. We discovered that low abundance of Rab27a resulted in 
decreased hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and protein abundances in virus-infected
cells. Curiously, both cell-associated and extracellular virus yield decreased in
Rab27a depleted cells, suggesting that reduced exosome secretion did not cause
the observed effect. Instead, Rab27a enhanced viral RNA replication by a
mechanism that involves the liver-specific microRNA miR-122. Rab27a surrounded
lipid droplets and was enriched in membrane fractions that harbor viral
replication proteins, suggesting a supporting role for Rab27a in viral gene
expression. Curiously, Rab27a depletion decreased the abundance of miR-122,
whereas overexpression of miR-122 in Rab27a-depleted cells rescued HCV RNA
abundance. Because intracellular HCV RNA abundance is enhanced by the binding of 
two miR-122 molecules to the extreme 5' end of the HCV RNA genome, the diminished
amounts of miR-122 in Rab27a-depleted cells could have caused destabilization of 
HCV RNA. However, the abundance of HCV RNA carrying mutations on both
miR-122-binding sites and whose stability was supported by ectopically expressed 
miR-122 mimetics with compensatory mutations also decreased in Rab27a-depleted
cells. This result indicates that the effect of Rab27a depletion on HCV RNA
abundance does not depend on the formation of 5' terminal HCV/miR-122 RNA
complexes, but that miR-122 has a Rab27a-dependent function in the HCV lifecycle,
likely the downregulation of a cellular inhibitor of HCV gene expression. These
findings suggest that the absence of miR-122 results in a vulnerability not only 
to exoribonucleases that attack the viral genome, but also to upregulation of one
more cellular factor that inhibit viral gene expression.

BACKGROUND: microRNA-122 (miR-122) is the most abundant and specific miRNA in the
liver. It acts as an important tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
through regulating its target genes, but details of its own regulation are
largely unknown. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a transcription factor with multiple
functions, plays an important role in protecting against liver carcinogenesis,
but it is unclear whether the anti-HCC effect of FXR is involved in the
regulation of miR-122.
METHODS: The levels of miR-122 and FXR in HCC tissues and cell lines were
examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was also used to detect
the expression of miR-122 target genes at mRNA level, while Western blotting was 
used to analyze that of their protein products. The effect of FXR on the
transcriptional activity of miR-122 promoter was evaluated by a luciferase
reporter assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were performed to identify the FXR binding site 
within miR-122 promoter region. The cell proliferation was analyzed by a CCK-8
assay. The influence of FXR on tumor growth and miR-122 expression in vivo was
monitored using HCC xenografts in nude mice.
RESULTS: The expression of FXR was positively correlated with that of miR-122 in 
HCC tissues and cell lines. Activation of FXR in HCC cells upregulated miR-122
expression and in turn downregulated the expression of miR-122 target genes
including insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and cyclin G1. FXR bound directly
to the DR2 element (-338 to -325) in miR-122 promoter region, and enhanced the
promoter's transcriptional activity. Functional experiments showed that the
FXR-mediated upregulation of miR-122 suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells in
vitro and the growth of HCC xenografts in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-122 is a novel target gene of FXR, and the upregulation of
miR-122 by FXR represses the growth of HCC cells, suggesting that FXR may serve
as a key transcriptional regulator for manipulating miR-122 expression, and the
FXR/miR-122 pathway may therefore be a novel target for the treatment of HCC.

Because early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is difficult to diagnose using
the existing techniques, identifying better biomarkers would likely improve the
patients' prognoses. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
published studies to appraise the utility of microRNAs (miRNAs) for the early
diagnosis of HCC. Pertinent literature was collected from the Medline, Embase,
and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. We analyzed 50 studies
that included 3423 cases of HCC, 2403 chronic hepatic disease (CH) patients, and 
1887 healthy controls in 16 articles. Summary receiver operating characteristic
analyses of all miRNAs showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, with 75.8%
sensitivity and 75.0% specificity in discriminating patients with HCC from
healthy controls. miR-21 and miR-122 individually distinguished patients with HCC
from healthy controls, with an AUC of 0.88 for miR-21 and 0.77 for miR-122. The
sensitivity and specificity for miR-21 were 86.6% and 79.5%, respectively, those 
for miR-122 were 68.0% and 73.3%. We conclude that circulating miRNAs,
particularly miR-21, and miR-122, are promising biomarkers for the early
diagnosis of HCC.

Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process that evolves from cirrhosis or
dysplastic nodule (DN), and eventually leads to overt hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Differentiation between early HCC and DN is an important issue in the
clinical setting. This study aims to investigate the potential of circulating
microRNA (miRNA) levels in the diagnosis of early HCC. RNA was extracted from
sera of 30 chronic hepatitis B patients with pathologically proven DN and 120
age- and sex-matched patients with early HCC. Paired samples were collected from 
ten patients with DN who developed overt HCC in the follow-up. A panel of ten
cancer-associated miRNAs was analyzed by quantitative real-time
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Serum levels of miR-16, miR-122,
miR-221, let-7b and miR-15b were significantly lower in patients with DN than in 
the HCC group. When DN progressed to overt HCC, serum miR-122, miR-let-7b and
miR-15b levels increased significantly (p = 0.046, 0.043 and 0.044,
respectively). As a single marker, α-fetoprotein (AFP) and miR-122 as well as
let-7b had the similar performance for differentiate HCC from DN. As limited to
subjects with normal AFP, let-7b resulted in a sensitivity of 84.8% and a
specificity of 50% in separating HCC and DN with a cutoff value of 3.5 (p =
0.001). In conclusion, miR-122 and let-7b, which are upregulated in the serum of 
early-HCC patients, can be useful markers for differentiating early HCC from DN
in chronic hepatitis B patients.

University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

To clarify the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and investigate the
effects of potential therapies, a number of mouse models have been developed.
Subcutaneous xenograft models are widely used in the past decades. Yet, with the 
advent of in vivo imaging technology, investigators are more and more concerned
with the orthotopic models nowadays. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEM)
have greatly facilitated studies of gene function in HCC development. Recently,
GEM of miR-122 and miR-221 provided new approaches for better understanding of
the in vivo functions of microRNA in hepatocarcinogenesis. Chemically induced
liver tumors in animals share many of the morphological, histogenic, and
biochemical features of human HCC. Yet, the complicated and obscure genomic
alternation restricts their applications. In this review, we highlight both the
frequently used mouse models and some emerging ones with emphasis on their merits
or defects, and give advises for investigators to chose a "best-fit" animal model
in HCC research.

MicroRNA-122 affects cell aggressiveness and apoptosis by targeting PKM2 in human
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly invasive tumor with frequent
distant metastasis, which is the main cause for the poor prognosis. However, the 
mechanisms for metastasis remain poorly investigated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have
been implicated in HCC progression. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is considered as a
tumor suppressor in human cancer. In the present study, miR-122 expression was
found to be significantly lower in HCC than the level in normal tumor-adjacent
tissues. miR-122 was clearly silenced or downregulated in five HCC cell lines
(HepG2, Hep3B, MHCC97H, Huh7 and SMMC-7721) compared with normal hepatocytes
(LO2). HCC patients with low expression of miR-122 had a poor 3-year survival.
Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that
miR-122 is an independent prognostic factor in HCC. Downregulation of miR-122
promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in Hep3B cells. We found that the 
public miRNA database (TargetScan) predicted that PKM2 may be a target for
miR-122, and the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PKM2 contains a highly
conserved binding site for miR-122. To identify this, pre-miR-122/anti-miR-122
were respectively transfected into the Hep3B cell line. We found that miR-122
overexpression significantly reduced the level of PKM2. Moreover, knockdown of
PKM2 significantly increased miR-122 inhibitor-mediated Hep3B cell apoptosis and 
reduced miR-122 inhibitor-mediated Hep3B cell migration and invasion. Moreover,
re-expression of PKM2 partially abrogated miR-122-induced HCC cell growth arrest 
and apoptosis in vivo. In conclusion, miR-122 serves as a prognostic biomarker
and induces apoptosis and growth arrest by downregulating PKM2 in HCC.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a variety of biological processes. The
liver-specific, highly abundant miR-122 is implicated in many human diseases
including cancer. Its inhibition has been found to result in a dramatic loss in
the ability of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) to infect host cells. Both antisense
technology and small molecules have been used to independently inhibit endogenous
miR-122 function, but not in combination. Intracellular stability, efficient
delivery, hydrophobicity, and controlled release are some of the current
challenges associated with these novel therapeutic methods. Reported herein is
the first single-vehicular system, based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles
(MSNs), for simultaneous cellular delivery of miR-122 antagomir and small
molecule inhibitors. The controlled release of both types of inhibitors depends
on the expression levels of endogenous miR-122, thus enabling these drug-loaded
MSNs to achieve combination inhibition of its targeted mRNAs in Huh7 cells.

MiR-122 is a major hepatic microRNA, accounting for more than 70% of the total
liver miRNA population. It has been shown that miR-122 is associated with liver
diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Mir-122 is an intergenic miRNA with
its own promoter. Pri-miR-122 expression is regulated by liver-enriched
transcription factors, mainly by HNF4α, which mediates the expression via the
interaction with a specific DR1 site. It has been shown that
phenobarbital-mediated activation of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR),
xenobiotic nuclear receptor, is associated with a decrease in miR-122 in the
liver. In the present study, we investigated HNF4α-CAR cross-talk in the
regulation of miR-122 levels and promitogenic signalling in mouse livers. The
level of miR-122 was significantly repressed by treatment with
1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP), which is an agonist of
mouse CAR. ChIP assays demonstrated that TCPOBOP-activated CAR inhibited HNF4α
transactivation by competing with HNF4α for binding to the DR1 site in the
pri-miR-122 promoter. Such transcription factor replacement was strongly
correlated with miR-122 down-regulation. Additionally, the decrease in miR-122
levels produced by CAR activation is accompanied by an increase in mRNA and
cellular protein levels of E2f1 and its accumulation on the target cMyc gene
promoter. The increase in accumulation of E2f1 on the target cMyc gene promoter
is accompanied by an increase in cMyc levels and transcriptional activity. Thus, 
our results provide evidence to support the conclusion that CAR activation
decreases miR-122 levels through suppression of HNF4α transcriptional activity
and indirectly regulates the promitogenic protein cMyc. HNF4α-CAR cross-talk may 
provide new opportunities for understanding liver diseases and developing more
effective therapeutic approaches to better drug treatments.

AIM: To investigate whether expression of selected miRNAs obtained from fibrotic 
liver biopsies correlate with fibrosis stage.
METHODS: Altogether, 52 patients were enrolled in the study representing various 
etiologic backgrounds of fibrosis: 24 cases with chronic hepatitis infections
(types B, C), 19 with autoimmune liver diseases (autoimmune hepatitis, primary
biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, overlapping syndrome cases),
and 9 of mixed etiology (alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatosis, cryptogenic
cases). Severity of fibrosis was determined by both histologic staging using the 
METAVIR scoring system and noninvasive transient elastography. Following RNA
isolation, expression levels of miR-21, miR-122, miR-214, miR-221, miR-222, and
miR-224 were determined using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays applying miR-140 as the
reference. Selection of miRNAs was based on their characteristic up- or
downregulation observed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Relative expression of
miRNAs was correlated with fibrosis stage and liver stiffness (LS) value measured
by transient elastography, as well as with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
level.
RESULTS: The expression of individual miRNAs showed deregulated patterns in
stages F1-F4 as compared with stage F0, but only the reduced level of miR-122 in 
stage F4 was statistically significant (P < 0.04). When analyzing miRNA
expression in relation to fibrosis, levels of miR-122 and miR-221 showed negative
correlations with fibrosis stage, and miR-122 was found to correlate negatively
and miR-224 positively with LS values (all P < 0.05). ALT levels displayed a
positive correlation with miR-21 (P < 0.04). Negative correlations were observed 
in the fibrosis samples of mixed etiology between miR-122 and fibrosis stage and 
LS values (P < 0.05), and in the samples of chronic viral hepatitis, between
miR-221 and fibrosis stage (P < 0.01), whereas miR-21 showed positive correlation
with ALT values in the samples of autoimmune liver diseases (P < 0.03). The
results also revealed a strong correlation between fibrosis stage and LS values
(P < 0.01) when etiology of fibrosis was not taken into account.
CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of miR-122 in advanced fibrosis and its
correlation with fibrosis stage and LS values seem to be characteristic of
hepatic fibrosis of various etiologies.

Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading risk factor for
the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With nearly 750000 deaths
yearly, hepatocellular carcinoma is the second highest cause of cancer-related
death in the world. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to
the development of HBV-associated HCC remain incompletely understood. Recently,
microRNAs (miRNAs), a family of small non-coding RNAs that play a role primarily 
in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been recognized as important
regulators of cellular homeostasis, and altered regulation of miRNA expression
has been suggested to play a significant role in virus-associated diseases and
the development of many cancers. With this in mind, many groups have begun to
investigate the relationship between miRNAs and HBV replication and
HBV-associated disease. Multiple findings suggest that some miRNAs, such as
miR-122, and miR-125 and miR-199 family members, are playing a role in HBV
replication and HBV-associated disease, including the development of
HBV-associated HCC. In this review, we discuss the current state of our
understanding of the relationship between HBV and miRNAs, including how HBV
affects cellular miRNAs, how these miRNAs impact HBV replication, and the
relationship between HBV-mediated miRNA regulation and HCC development. We also
address the impact of challenges in studying HBV, such as the lack of an
effective model system for infectivity and a reliance on transformed cell lines, 
on our understanding of the relationship between HBV and miRNAs, and propose
potential applications of miRNA-related techniques that could enhance our
understanding of the role miRNAs play in HBV replication and HBV-associated
disease, ultimately leading to new therapeutic options and improved patient
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding small ribonucleic acids
that have emerged as one of the central players of gene expression regulation.
This study was designed to determine and identify miRNAs that are associated with
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).
METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: sham and RYGB.
Changes in food intake and body weight were measured. miRNA microarray analyses
on the brain hypothalamus and heart were performed. The expressions of miR-122
were analyzed, and the activities of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) were determined in the hypothalamus, heart, and liver. Antisense
oligonucleotide miR-122 was transfected into hepatocellular carcinoma cells to
validate in vivo results.
RESULTS: Body weights decreased in the RYGB group compared with those in sham
group. Food intake was different between sham and RYGB groups. Of 350 miRNAs that
were investigated, we observed that miR-122, being predominantly found in the
liver, markedly increased (>35-fold) in the hypothalamus and decreased (>4-fold) 
in the heart. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that
expression of miR-122 was induced in hypothalamus but attenuated in the heart and
liver of the RYGB group. Activities of AMPK were decreased in the hypothalamus
but increased in the heart and liver. Knockdown of miR-122 in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells stimulated phosphorylation levels AMPK.
CONCLUSIONS: The results in this study suggest that RYGB regulates the
expressions of miR-122 in the hypothalamus, heart, and liver, which in turn may
modulate the activities of AMPK, the master regulator of metabolism.

OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic potential of
plasma microRNA-122 levels in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related
hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatic resection or radiofrequency ablation
(RFA).
DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients with HBV-related hepatocellular
carcinoma who underwent hepatic resection (n=63) or RFA (n=57) were included. The
pretreatment plasma microRNA-122 level was assessed using quantitative real time 
polymerase chain reaction, and the correlation between microRNA-122 expression
and various clinical parameters was investigated.
RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that, in all patients,
a low platelet count (<100×10(9)/L), low albumin level (≤3.5g/dL.), and advanced 
tumor stage (modified Union for International Cancer Control stage III/IV) were
independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival, while a low albumin
level and advanced tumor stage were independent prognostic factors for overall
survival (OS). In a subgroup analysis of patients who underwent RFA, the patients
with high miR-122 expression (>100) had significantly lower OS on Kaplan-Meier
analysis (P=0.042). Furthermore, high microRNA-122 expression (hazard ratio
[HR]=2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12-6.35; P=0.026) and advanced tumor
stage (HR=2.27; 95% CI=1.23-4.18; P=0.009) were independent risk factors for poor
OS in patients treated with RFA. The combination of microRNA-122 and tumor stage 
resulted in an area under the curve of 0.818 for predicting 1-year OS in patients
who underwent RFA.
CONCLUSIONS: High plasma microRNA-122 expression was associated with poor OS in
patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent RFA.

Many patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develop lung
metastasis and available treatments are limited. The anticancer drug sorafenib
has opened a window of hope for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
However, the effect of sorafenib is limited by drug resistance. MicroRNAs have
been reported to play an important role in HCC, but the effect of sorafenib on
microRNAs (miRNAs) and on lung metastasis is not clear. This report employed a
high-throughput deep sequencing technique to detect the difference of miRNAs and 
immunohistochemical technique to detect the difference of protein in implanted
primary tumors and in metastatic HCC tumors after treatment with sorafenib. Among
the detected miRNAs, we identified rno-miR-122-3p and rmo-miR-122-5p that were
downregulated and rno-miR-383-5p and rno-miR-34a-5p that were upregulated and one
novel miRNAs is reported as downregulated here for the first time.
Immunohistochemical analysis of known miRNAs identified CMYC protein expression
as inhibited, MDM2 protein was expressed, and NM23 and GST protein were
upregulated. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of
novel miRNA found that the targeted genes were concentrated in pathways of
metabolism, especially in cytochrome P450. These results indicate that these
miRNAs are likely to be involved in the treatment response of lung metastases of 
HCC to sorafenib. They may be useful as biomarkers to predict the clinical
treatment response of sorafenib.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is implicated as a regulator of physiological and
pathophysiological processes in the liver. Overexpression of Gα12 is associated
with overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Array-based miRNA profiling was performed on Huh7 stably transfected with
activated Gα12 to find miRNAs regulated by the Gα12 pathway; among them, miR-122 
was most greatly repressed. miR-122 directly inhibits c-Met expression, playing a
role in HCC progression. Gα12 destabilized HNF4α by accelerating ubiquitination, 
impeding constitutive expression of miR-122. miR-122 mimic transfection
diminished the ability of Gα12 to increase c-Met and to activate ERK, STAT3, and 
Akt/mTOR, suppressing cell proliferation with augmented apoptosis. Consistently, 
miR-122 transfection prohibited tumor cell colony formation and endothelial tube 
formation. In a xenograft model, Gα12 knockdown attenuated c-Met expression by
restoring HNF4α levels, and elicited tumor cell apoptosis but diminished Ki67
intensities. In human HCC samples, Gα12 levels correlated to c-Met and were
inversely associated with miR-122. Both miR-122 and c-Met expression
significantly changed in tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage II/III tumors.
Moreover, changes in Gα12 and miR-122 levels discriminated recurrence-free and
overall survival rates of HCC patients. Collectively, Gα12 overexpression in HCC 
inhibits MIR122 transactivation by inactivating HNF4α, which causes c-Met
induction, contributing to cancer aggressiveness.

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) exist stably in body fluids and are potential
biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twenty-five patients with
cirrhosis that evolved into HCC, who were treated at The Third Hospital of
Zhenjiang Affiliated to Jiangsu University between January 2005 and December
2012, were enrolled. In the discovery stage, 2 serum samples pooled from 3
cirrhosis and 3 HCC samples were subjected to deep sequencing. Subsequently,
differential expression of miRNAs was validated by quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the serum samples from an
independent cohort of 22 patients with cirrhosis and HCC. Twenty-two miRNAs
showed a >2-fold upregulation (P<0.01), and 2 miRNAs showed a >2-fold
downregulation (P<0.01) in the cirrhosis and HCC samples. Using the comparative
Ct method, we calculated the 2-(ΔΔCt) for 40 candidate miRNAs in the sample sets.
Eight of the 40 miRNAs demonstrated significantly differential expression levels 
between the disease categories. The miRNAs exhibiting differential expression
were hsa-miR-122-5p, has-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-486-5p, has-miR-193b-5p,
hsa-miR-206, has-miR-141-3p, has-miR-192-5p and has-miR-26a-5p. We identified the
miRNAs differentially expressed in cirrhosis that evolved into hepatitis B
virus-related HCC.

Identification of circulating MicroRNAs as novel potential biomarkers for
hepatocellular carcinoma detection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

530021, China.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in body fluids such as serum and plasma can be
stably detected and used as potential biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate circulating miRNAs from HCC expression
profiling studies and to determine miRNA biomarkers for HCC detection.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies were carried 
out for comparing the circulating miRNA expressions between HCC patients and
healthy people, hepatitis, or cirrhosis patients. A miRNA ranking system that
considered the number of comparisons in agreement and total number of samples was
used. Then the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve (sROC) results of 
the top miRNAs were combined to further evaluate their diagnostic value using
Meta-disc 1.4.
RESULTS: In the 17 included studies, three circulating miRNAs (miR-21, miR-122,
and miR-223) were repeatedly reported three times or more in both HCC patients
vs. healthy controls and vs. other hepatitis or cirrhosis patients. In further
analysis, the area under curve (AUC) of sROC for miR-21, miR-122 and miR-223 in
discriminating HCC patients from healthy people are 0.9293, 0.8128, and 0.8597,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miR-21 has highest level of diagnostic efficiency among 
three miRNAs candidate biomarkers (miR-21, miR-122, and miR-223) for detection of
HCC.

Military Area Command, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).

BACKGROUND: Liver-specific microRNA (miR)-122 has been shown to be involved in
regulating translation of hepatitis C viral (HCV) RNA. This study aimed to
explore the molecular mechanism of miR-122 in regulating HCV RNA translation
initiation.
MATERIAL/METHODS: In human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, UV
cross-link assay was performed on a large scale to identify RNA-binding proteins 
with gradient concentrations of miR-122. Analytical ultracentrifugation was then 
used to separate the translation initiation complexes. All RNA-binding proteins
were then identified by Western blotting.
RESULTS: The binding of 68 kDa protein (p68) to HCV RNA was suppressed by the
addition of miR-122 via the competitive binding assay. Such inhibition can be
eliminated by the addition of 2'-O-methylated oligonucleotides. This binding
suppression was determined to be specific for miR-122, which used the mature
single-stranded RNA to suppress the binding of p68 onto HCV RNA. This binding
inhibition was further validated by using authentic miR-122 with conserved
regions and mutated sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: The binding of p68 onto HCV RNA can be specifically inhibited by
miR-122 via a competitive binding process.

Regulation of the oncogenic function of distal-less 4 by microRNA-122 in
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Distal-less 4 (DLX4) is a member of the DLX family of homeobox genes. Recent
reports have suggested that abnormal expression of DLX4 is present in several
types of human tumors, including breast cancer, leukemia and colon cancer.
However, the function and the mechanistic regulation of DLX4 in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) are elusive. In the present study, a proportion of hepatocellular
carcinomas were identified to exhibit upregulated DLX4 expression. This study
proposed that the overexpression of DLX4 is associated with the downregulation of
miR-122, an underexpressed miRNA in human HCC. Functional studies have
demonstrated that the downregulation of DLX4 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines is regulated by miR-122 through binding to its 3'UTR. Furthermore, a DLX4
overexpression vector lacking the 3'UTR was shown to abolish miR-122-induced
inhibition of proliferation in the HCC cell line Hep3B. These results gave new
insight into the mechanism of the miR-122/DLX4 axis in HCC.

TP-1 is a polysaccharide from one famous fungus Huaier. Treatment with TP-1
significantly inhibited the cell growth, adhesion, migration, and motility of
SMMC-7721 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
revealed a dose-dependent decrease in RNA-binding factor 1 (AUF-1) and astrocyte 
elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in TP-1-treated SMMC-7721
cells, which is consistent with their protein expression detected by Western
blotting. On the contrary, microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression increased in
SMMC-7721 cells following TP-1 treatment. Moreover, TP-1 treatment at three doses
apparently increased epithelial marker E-cadherin protein expression but
decreased the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin protein level. In addition, the
hematoxylin-eosin (H & E) staining showed that the TP-1 significantly inhibited
the lung metastasis of liver cancer in mice orthotopic implanted with SMMC-7721
tumor tissue. Taken together, these findings proved the inhibitory effect of TP-1
on the growth and metastasis of SMMC-7721 cells, and TP-1 might be offered for
future application as a powerful chemopreventive agent against hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) metastasis.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is involved in the pathogenesis of several liver diseases,
including chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study 
aimed to explore the potential role of miR-122 in the interferon (IFN)-mediated
suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in hepatocytes. We found that elevated
expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) following HBV infection,
contributed to the inactivation of the IFN signaling pathway. Based on previous
studies from our laboratory showing that miR-122 can modulate type I IFN
expression by inhibiting SOCS1 expression, we analyzed the SOCS3 mRNA sequence
for putative miR-122 binding sites. We demonstrate that miR-122 inhibits SOCS3
expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of the SOCS3 mRNA within the
region 1887-1910 nucleotides. Finally, we demonstrate that significantly
increased levels of IFN lead to decreased HBV expression in miR-122 mimic-treated
Huh7 cells, whereas inhibition of endogenous miR-122 leads to enhanced viral
production, owing to a marked decrease in IFN expression. Taken together, our
results demonstrate that miR-122 down-regulates SOCS3, thus positively affecting 
the anti-HBV efficiency of endogenous type I IFN. Our study suggests that
suppression of miR-122 induced by HBV infection, leads to the inactivation of IFN
expression, which in turn enhances HBV replication, contributing to viral
persistence and hepatocarcinogenesis.

Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a typical feature of human hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). However, the in vivo relevance of miRNAs along
hepatocarcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we show that liver tumors
induced in mice by c-Myc overexpression or AKT/Ras co-expression exhibit distinct
miRNA expression profiles. Among the downregulated miRNAs, eight (miR-101,
miR-107, miR-122, miR-29, miR-365, miR-375, miR-378, and miR-802) were selected
and their tumor suppressor activity was determined by overexpressing each of them
together with c-Myc or AKT/Ras oncogenes in mouse livers via hydrodynamic
transfection. The tumor suppressor activity of these microRNAs was extremely
heterogeneous in c-Myc and AKT/Ras mice: while miR-378 had no tumor suppressor
activity, miR-107, mir-122, miR-29, miR-365 and miR-802 exhibited weak to
moderate tumor suppressor potential. Noticeably, miR-375 showed limited
antineoplastic activity against c-Myc driven tumorigenesis, whereas it strongly
inhibited AKT/Ras induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, miR-101
significantly suppressed both c-Myc and AKT/Ras liver tumor development.
Altogether, the present data demonstrate that different oncogenes induce distinct
miRNA patterns, whose modulation differently affects hepatocarcinogenesis
depending on the driving oncogenes. Finally, our findings support a strong tumor 
suppressor activity of miR-101 in liver cancer models regardless of the driver
oncogenes involved, thus representing a promising therapeutic target in human
HCC.

Integrated analyses to reconstruct microRNA-mediated regulatory networks in mouse
liver using high-throughput profiling.

Hsu SD, Huang HY, Chou CH, Sun YM, Hsu MT, Tsou AP.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) simultaneously target many transcripts through
partial complementarity binding, and have emerged as a key type of
post-transcriptional regulator for gene expression. How miRNA accomplishes its
pleiotropic effects largely depends on its expression and its target repertoire. 
Previous studies discovered thousands of miRNAs and numerous miRNA target genes
mainly through computation and prediction methods which produced high rates of
false positive prediction. The development of Argonaute cross-linked
immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) provides a
system to effectively determine miRNA target genes. Likewise, the accuracy of
dissecting the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes has been greatly
improved by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the transcription factors coupled
with sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Elucidation of the miRNA target repertoire will
provide an in-depth understanding of the functional roles of microRNA pathways.
To reliably reconstruct a miRNA-mediated regulatory network, we established a
computational framework using publicly available, sequence-based transcription
factor-miRNA databases, including ChIPBase and TransmiR for the TF-miRNA
interactions, along with miRNA-target databases, including miRTarBase, TarBase
and starBase, for the miRNA-target interactions. We applied the computational
framework to elucidate the miRNA-mediated regulatory network in the Mir122a⁻/⁻
mouse model, which has an altered transcriptome and progressive liver disease.
RESULTS: We applied our computational framework to the expression profiles of
miRNA/mRNA of Mir122a⁻/⁻ mutant mice and wild-type mice. The miRNA-mediated
network involves 40 curated TFs contributing to the aberrant expression of 65
miRNAs and 723 curated miRNA target genes, of which 56% was found in the
differentially-expressed genes of Mir122a--mice. Hence, the regulatory network
disclosed previously-known and also many previously-unidentified miRNA-mediated
regulations in mutant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of imprinting at
the chromosome 12qF1 region is associated with miRNA overexpression in human
hepatocellular carcinoma and stem cells, suggesting initiation of precancerous
changes in young mice deficient in miR-122. A group of 9 miRNAs was found to
share miR-122 target genes, indicating synergy between miRNAs and target genes by
way of multiplicity and cooperativity.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides significant insight into miRNA-mediated
regulatory networks. Based on experimentally verified data, this network is
highly reliable and effective in revealing previously-undetermined
disease-associated molecular mechanisms. This computational framework can be
applied to explore the significant TF-miRNA-miRNA target interactions in any
complex biological systems with high degrees of confidence.

Medical University, Shenyang, 100004, China.

Previous studies have shown that some microRNAs (miRs) are intensively involved
in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We analyzed the prognostic role
of serum microRNA (miR-122) levels in hepatocellular carcinoma patients using a
retrospective design. MiR-122 levels in 122 hepatocellular carcinoma patients
were measured, and Cox regression analysis was performed to analyze the
prognostic role of miR-122 in hepatocellular carcinoma, and the hazard ratio (HR)
with 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) was used to evaluate its prognostic role. 
Patients with large tumor size had lower levels of serum miR-122 (P = 0.04).
However, there was no significant association of serum miR-122 levels with other 
clinical characteristics. Kaplan-Meier method showed that there was higher
overall survival rate in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with high serum
miR-122 levels compared with those with low miR-122 level (P < 0.01). When using 
Cox regression analysis, high serum miR-122 level was independently associated
with better overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HR = 0.26; 95 
%CI 0.14-0.47, P < 0.01). Subgroup analysis by gender showed that high serum
miR-122 level was independently associated with better overall survival in male
patients (HR = 0.08; 95 %CI 0.03-0.22, P < 0.01), but not in female patients
(HR = 0.48; 95 %CI 0.18-1.32, P = 0.16). Thus, the outcomes in the analysis
suggest that high serum miR-122 level is independently associated with higher
overall survival rate in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and it is a good
biomarker of better prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor, with a high mortality rate
due to late symptom presentation and frequent tumor recurrences and metastasis.
It is also a rapidly growing tumor supported by different metabolic mechanisms;
nevertheless, the biological and molecular mechanisms involved in the metabolic
reprogramming in HCC are unclear. In this study, we found that pyruvate kinase M2
(PKM2) was frequently over-expressed in human HCCs and its over-expression was
associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor prognosis of HCC
patients. Furthermore, knockdown of PKM2 suppressed aerobic glycolysis and cell
proliferation in HCC cell lines in vitro. Importantly, knockdown of PKM2 hampered
HCC growth in both subcutaneous injection and orthotopic liver implantation
models, and reduced lung metastasis in vivo. Of significance, PKM2
over-expression in human HCCs was associated with a down-regulation of a
liver-specific microRNA, miR-122. We further showed that miR-122 interacted with 
the 3UTR of the PKM2 gene. Re-expression of miR-122 in HCC cell lines reduced
PKM2 expression, decreased glucose uptake in vitro, and suppressed HCC tumor
growth in vivo. Our clinical data and functional studies have revealed a novel
biological mechanism involved in HCC metabolic reprogramming.

OBJECTIVES: Patients infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C
virus (HCV) are at greater risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The
objective of this study was to identify virus-specific serum microRNA profiles
associated with liver function and disease progression. Microarray analysis of
serum microRNAs was performed using the Toray 3D array system in 22 healthy
subjects, 42 HBV patients, and 30 HCV patients. Selected microRNAs were then
validated by qRT-PCR in 186 HBV patients, 107 HCV patients, and 22 healthy
subjects.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed up-regulation of a number of microRNAs in
serum of both HBV and HCV patients. In qRT-PCR analysis, miR-122, miR-99a,
miR-125b, miR-720, miR-22, and miR-1275 were up-regulated both in HBV patients
relative to healthy subjects, and all except miR-1275 were up-regulated in
HBeAg-positive patients relative to HBeAg-negative patients. Specific microRNAs
were independently associated with different aspects of HBV infection. MiR-122
was independently associated with HBV DNA level, whereas miR-125b was
independently associated with levels of HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg. MiR-22 and
miR-1275 were independently associated with serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum microRNA levels reflect differences in the etiology and stage 
of viral hepatitis.

AIM: To explore the potential usefulness of serum miR-122 and miR-221 as
non-invasive diagnostic markers of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted on 90 adult patients of both sex
with HCV-related chronic liver disease and chronic hepatitis C related HCC. In
addition to the 10 healthy control individuals, patients were stratified into;
interferon-naïve chronic hepatitis C (CH) (n = 30), post-hepatitis C compensated 
cirrhosis (LC) (n = 30) and treatment-naïve HCC (n = 30). All patients and
controls underwent full clinical assessment and laboratory investigations in
addition to the evaluation of the level of serum miRNA expression by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: There was a significant fold change in serum miRNA expression in the
different patient groups when compared to normal controls; miR-122 showed
significant fold increasing in both CH and HCC and significant fold decrease in
LC. On the other hand, miR-221 showed significant fold elevation in both CH and
LC groups and significant fold decrease in HCC group (P = 0.01). Comparing fold
changes in miRNAs in HCC group vs non HCC group (CH and Cirrhosis), there was
non-significant fold elevation in miR-122 (P = 0.21) and significant fold
decreasing in miR-221 in HCC vs non-HCC (P = 0.03). ROC curve analysis for
miR-221 yielded 87% sensitivity and 40% specificity for the differentiation of
HCC patients from non-HCC at a cutoff 1.82.
CONCLUSION: Serum miR-221 has a strong potential to serve as one of the novel
non-invasive biomarkers of HCC.

BACKGROUND: Our previous study identified AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 as unfavorable
prognostic factors for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However,
limited data are available on their exact mechanisms in HCC. Since microRNAs
(miRNAs) are implicated in various human cancers including HCC, we aimed to
screen miRNAs targeting AKTs and investigate their underlying mechanisms in HCC
by integrating bioinformatics prediction, network analysis, functional assay and 
clinical validation.
METHODS: Five online programs of miRNA target prediction and RNAhybrid which
calculate the minimum free energy (MFE) of the duplex miRNA:mRNA were used to
screen optimized miRNA-AKT interactions. Then, miRNA-regulated protein
interaction network was constructed and 5 topological features ('Degree',
'Node-betweenness', 'Edge-betweenness', 'Closeness' and 'Modularity') were
analyzed to link candidate miRNA-AKT interactions to oncogenesis and cancer
hallmarks. Further systematic experiments were performed to validate the
prediction results.
RESULTS: Six optimized miRNA-AKT interactions (miR-149-AKT1, miR-302d-AKT1,
miR-184-AKT2, miR-708-AKT2, miR-122-AKT3 and miR-124-AKT3) were obtained by
combining the miRNA target prediction and MFE calculation. Then, 103 validated
targets for the 6 candidate miRNAs were collected from miRTarBase. According to
the enrichment analysis on GO items and KEGG pathways, these validated targets
were significantly enriched in many known oncogenic pathways for HCC. In
addition, miRNA-regulated protein interaction network were divided into 5
functional modules. Importantly, AKT1 and its interaction with mTOR respectively 
had the highest node-betweenness and edge-betweenness, implying their bottleneck 
roles in the network. Further experiments confirmed that miRNA-149 directly
targeted AKT1 in HCC by a miRNA luciferase reporter approach. Then, re-expression
of miR-149 significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by
regulating AKT1/mTOR pathway. Notably, miR-149 down-regulation in clinical HCC
tissues was correlated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis of patients.
CONCLUSION: This comprehensive analysis identified a list of miRNAs targeting
AKTs and revealed their critical roles in HCC malignant progression. Especially, 
miR-149 may function as a tumor suppressive miRNA and play an important role in
inhibiting the HCC tumorigenesis by modulating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Our clinical
evidence also highlight the prognostic potential of miR-149 in HCC. The newly
identified miR-149/AKT/mTOR axis might be a promising therapeutic target in the
prevention and treatment of HCC.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a mammalian liver-specific miRNA, has been reported to
play crucial roles in the control of diverse aspects of hepatic function and
dysfunction, including viral infection and hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study,
we explored the clinical significance, transcriptional regulation, and direct
target of miR-122 in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Reduced expression of miR-122 in patients with HBV-associated hepatocellular
carcinoma was correlated with venous invasion and poor prognosis. Furthermore,
UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-10
(GALNT10) was identified as a bona fide target of miR-122 in hepatoma cells.
Ectopic expression and knockdown studies showed that GALNT10 indeed promotes
proliferation and apoptosis resistance of hepatoma cells in a
glycosyltransferase-dependent manner. Critically, adverse correlation between
miR-122 and GALNT10, a poor prognosticator of clinical outcome, was demonstrated 
in hepatoma patients. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4α), a liver-enriched
transcription factor that activates miR-122 gene transcription, was suppressed in
HBV-infected hepatoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed
significantly reduced association of Hnf4α with the miR-122 promoter in
HBV-infected hepatoma cells. Moreover, GALNT10 was found to intensify
O-glycosylation following signal activation of the epidermal growth factor
receptor. In addition, in a therapeutic perspective, we proved that GALNT10
silencing increases sensitivity to sorafenib and doxorubicin challenge. In
summary, our results reveal a novel Hnf4α/miR-122/GALNT10 regulatory pathway that
facilitates EGF miR-122 activation and hepatoma growth in HBV-associated
hepatocarcinogenesis.

Being the largest internal organ of the human body with the unique ability of
self-regeneration, the liver is involved in a wide variety of vital functions
that require highly orchestrated and controlled biochemical processes. Increasing
evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for the regulation of
liver development, regeneration and metabolic functions. Hence, alterations in
intrahepatic miRNA networks have been associated with liver disease including
hepatitis, steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-122 is
the most frequent miRNA in the adult liver, and a central player in liver biology
and disease. Furthermore, miR-122 has been shown to be an essential host factor
for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and an antiviral target, complementary to
the standard of care using direct-acting antivirals or interferon-based
treatment. This review summarizes our current understanding of the key role of
miR-122 in liver physiology and disease, highlighting its role in HCC and viral
hepatitis. We also discuss the perspectives of miRNA-based therapeutic approaches
for viral hepatitis and liver disease.

MicroRNA molecules have been increasingly regarded as a diagnostic and prognostic
marker of certain diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the
expression and clinical significance of miR-122 and miR-29 in liver disease
related to hepatitis B virus infection. The serum levels of miR-122 and miR-29 in
20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 20 patients with liver cirrhosis
(LC), 29 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 20 cases of hepatitis B virus
carriers (ASC), and 20 healthy controls (HC) were determined by a fluorescence
real-time quantitative PCR method and then evaluated by clinical correlation
analysis. Compared with the serum levels of miR-122 in the HC, LC, and ASC
groups, those in patients with HCC and CHB were significantly increased. The
serum levels of miR-29 in LC patients were lower than those in the healthy
controls (P < 0.01). A positive correlation was observed between the expression
of miR-122 and miR-29, and HBV DNA in patients with CHB. A negative correlation
was found between miR-29 and α-fetoprotein in patients with HCC. The elevation in
miR-122 was correlated with liver damage in CHB patients and with the
pathogenesis of liver cancer in HCC patients. The decrease in miR-29 expression
was related to the incidence of liver fibrosis. The detection of miR-122 and
miR-29 may be useful in evaluating the inflammatory liver injury and fibrosis
associated with chronic HBV infection.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly
tumors. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is effective for unresectable HCC.
In recent years, miRNAs have been proposed as novel diagnostic and prognostic
tools for HCC. This study aimed to identify whether microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve 
as biomarkers to reliably predict outcome before HCC patients are treated with
TACE.
METHODS: Eleven miRNAs (miR-, miR-19a, miR-101-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-200a, miR-21,
miR-214, miR-221, miR-222, miR-223 and miR-, -5p) were quantified by quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in 136 HCC patients' serum before they received TACE
therapy. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the
prognostic value of clinical parameters and miRNAs. Area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the prediction potency.
RESULTS: The levels of some miRNAs were dramatically associated with
clinicopathologic features regarding Child-Puge class, AFP, tumor size and
satellite nodules. Univariate analysis revealed that miR-200a, miR-21, miR-122
and miR-224-5p were significantly associated with patients' survival.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that AFP, satellite nodules and miR-200a were 
the independent prognostic factors associated with survival in this cohort
(p = 0.000, 0.001, 0.000, respectively). The probability of the prognostic
accuracy of miR-200a was 81.64% (74.47% specificity and 88.76% sensitivity),
which was higher than the classifier established by combination of AFP and
satellite nodules (76.87% probability, 70.21% specificity and 69.66%
sensitivity). Furthermore, the combination of AFP, satellite nodules and miR-200a
demonstrated as a classifier for HCC prognosis, yielding a ROC curve area of
88.19% (93.62% specificity and 68.54% sensitivity).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that serum miR-200a may prognosticate disease
outcome in HCC patients with TACE therapy. Therefore, miR-200a can potentially
guide individualized treatment for HCC patients with a high risk of TACE
treatment failures.

BACKGROUND: The identification of new high-sensitivity and high-specificity
markers for HCC are essential. We aimed to identify serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as
biomarkers to be used in diagnosing hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: We investigated serum miRNA expression in (261 HCC patients, 233
cirrhosis patients, and 173 healthy controls), recruited between August 2010 and 
June 2013. An initial screening of miRNA expression by Illumina sequencing was
performed using serum samples pooled from HCC patients and controls. Quantitative
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate
the expression of selected miRNAs. A logistic regression model was constructed
using a training cohort (n = 357) and then validated using an independent cohort 
(n = 241). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was
used to evaluate the accuracy of the use of the biomarkers for disease diagnosis.
RESULTS: We identified 8 miRNAs (hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-433-3p,
hsa-miR-1228-5p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p, and
hsa-miR-26a-5p) and constructed an miRNA set that provided high diagnostic
accuracy for HCC (AUC = 0.887 and 0.879 for training and validation sets,
respectively). The miRNAs could also be used to differentiate HCC patients from
healthy (AUC = 0.893) and cirrhosis (AUC = 0.892) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a serum of miRNA panel that has considerable clinical 
value in HCC diagnosis.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is an important host factor for
hepatitis C virus (HCV) and promotes HCV RNA accumulation. Decreased
intra-hepatic levels of miR-122 were observed in patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma, suggesting a potential role of miR-122 in the development of HCC.
Miravirsen targets miR-122 and resulted in a dose dependent and prolonged
decrease of HCV RNA levels in chronic hepatitis C patients. The aim of this study
was to establish the sustained virological response rate to peginterferon (P) and
ribavirin (R) following miravirsen dosing and to assess long-term safety in
patients treated with miravirsen.
METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective follow-up study we included 36
treatment naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 who received five
weekly subcutaneous injections with miravirsen or placebo over a 29-day period in
a phase 2a study. Patients were offered PR therapy 3weeks (3mg/kg group) or
6weeks (5 or 7mg/kg group) after completion of miravirsen or placebo dosing.
RESULTS: PR therapy was started in 14/36 patients of whom 12 had received
miravirsen. SVR was achieved in 7/12 patients previously dosed with miravirsen.
All patients dosed with 7mg/kg miravirsen who were subsequently treated with PR
achieved SVR. One patient had a prolonged undetectable HCV RNA period from week
14 to week 29 after baseline without subsequent antiviral therapy and relapsed
thereafter. None of the patients treated with anti-miR-122 developed HCC or other
liver-related complications.
CONCLUSION: No long-term safety issues were observed among 27 miravirsen-treated 
patients. Targeting miR-122 may be an effective and safe treatment strategy for
HCV infection and should be investigated in larger clinical trials.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has emerged as a common cause of chronic
liver disease and virus-independent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients
with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. To reveal the molecular mechanism
underlying hepatocarcinogenesis from NASH, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles
were analyzed in STAM mice, a NASH-HCC animal model. MicroRNA expression was also
examined in 42 clinical samples of HCC tissue. Histopathological images of the
liver of STAM mice at the ages of 6, 8, 12, and 18 weeks showed findings
compatible with fatty liver, NASH, liver cirrhosis (LC), and HCC, respectively.
Expression of miR-122 in non-tumor LC at the age of 18 weeks was significantly
lower than that in LC at the age of 12 weeks. Expression of miR-122 was further
decreased in HCCs relative to non-tumor LC at the age of 18 weeks. Expression of 
miR-122 was also decreased in clinical samples of liver tissue showing
macrovesicular steatosis and HCC, being consistent with the findings in the NASH 
model mice. DNA methylation analysis revealed that silencing of miR-122 was not
mediated by DNA hypermethylation of the promoter region. These results suggest
that silencing of miR-122 is an early event during hepatocarcinogenesis from
NASH, and that miR-122 could be a novel molecular marker for evaluating the risk 
of HCC in patients with NASH.

MicroRNA 122 (miR-122) is a tumor suppressor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
but is lowly expressed in HCC cells. MiR-151 is aberrantly overexpressed in HCC
cells and promotes HCC metastasis yet its roles on HCC tumorigenicity are
unknown. To combat HCC tumorigenicity/metastasis, we developed Sleeping Beauty
(SB)-based hybrid baculovirus (BV) vectors that expressed (i) miR-122 precursors 
(pre-miR-122), (ii) miR-151 sponges, or (iii) pre-miR-122 and miR-151 sponges.
Transduction of aggressive HCC cells (Mahlavu) with the pre-miR-122-expressing BV
tremendously enhanced miR-122 levels for >6 weeks, suppressed the levels of
downstream effectors (e.g., ADAM10 and Bcl-w), proliferation,
anchorage-independent growth, motility and migration/invasion in vitro.
Intratumoral injection of the pre-miR-122-expressing BV attenuated the HCC
growth/metastasis. The miR-151 sponges-expressing BV diminished the miR-151
levels for 6 weeks, enhanced RhoGDIA expression, suppressed RhoGTPases, as well
as motility and migration/invasion of Mahlavu cells. Intratumoral injection of
the miR-151 sponge-expressing BV impeded not only HCC metastasis but also cell
proliferation, MMP expression and tumor growth in vivo. The BV co-expressing
pre-miR-122 and miR-151 sponges also simultaneously enhanced miR-122 expression
and inhibited miR-151, and conferred antitumor/anti-metastasis effects albeit
lack of synergism. These data implicate the potentials of the SB-based hybrid BV 
for persistently modulating miRNA and suppressing HCC tumorigenicity/metastasis.

miR-122 plays a vital role in the development of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on data from the Encyclopedia
of DNA Elements (ENCODE), two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs4309483
and rs4503880, were identified in the upstream regulatory region of miR-122. A
case-control study consisting of 1,300 HBV-positive HCC cases, 1,344 HBV
carriers, and 1,344 persons who cleared HBV naturally was carried out to test the
association between the two SNPs and the risk for chronic HBV infection and HCC. 
The CA/AA genotypes of rs4309483 were associated with significantly increased
risk for HCC [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) = 1.02-1.43, P = 0.025] compared with HBV carriers, but decreased risk for 
chronic HBV infection (adjusted OR = 0.82, 95% CIs = 0.70-0.97, P = 0.017)
compared with persons who cleared HBV naturally. The genotype-expression
correlation between rs4309483 and the expression of primary or mature miR-122
expression was investigated in 29 pairs of HBV positive HCC and noncancerous
liver tissues. In noncancerous liver tissues, subjects carrying the CA genotype
exhibited significantly lower expression level of pri-miR-122 than those carrying
the CC genotype. In addition, positive or inverse correlation between the
expression levels of pri-miR-122 and mature miR-122 were observed in HCC tissues 
or noncancerous tissues, respectively. These findings indicate that the C to A
base change of rs4309483 may alter the expression of miR-122, thus providing
protective effect from chronic HBV infection but an increased risk for HCC in HBV
carriers.

The loss of microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression is strongly associated with
increased invasion and metastasis, and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the
present study, we observed that miR-122 over-expression in HCC cell lines
Sk-hep-1 and Bel-7402 triggered the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), as
demonstrated by epithelial-like morphological changes, up-regulated epithelial
proteins (E-cadherin, ZO-1, α-catenin, occludin, BVES, and MST4), and
down-regulated mesenchymal proteins (vimentin and fibronectin). The
over-expression of miRNA-122 also caused cytoskeleton disruption, RhoA/Rock
pathway inactivation, enhanced cell adhesion, and suppression of migration and
invasion of Sk-hep-1 and Bel-7402 cells, whereas, these effects could be reversed
through miR-122 inhibition. Additional studies demonstrated that the inhibition
of wild-type RhoA function induced MET and inhibited cell migration and invasion,
while RhoA over-expression reversed miR-122-induced MET and inhibition of
migration and invasion of HCC cells, suggesting that miR-122 induced MET and
suppressed the migration and invasion of HCC cells by targeting RhoA. Moreover,
our results demonstrated that HNF4α up-regulated its target gene miR-122 that
subsequently induced MET and inhibited cell migration and invasion, whereas
miR-122 inhibition reversed these HNF4α-induced phenotypes. These results
revealed functional and mechanistic links among the tumor suppressors HNF4α,
miR-122, and RhoA in EMT and invasive and metastatic phenotypes of HCC. Taken
together, our study provides the first evidence that the HNF4α/miR-122/RhoA axis 
negatively regulates EMT and the migration and invasion of HCC cells.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the major histological subtype of liver
cancer. Tumorigenic changes in hepatic cells potentially result from aberrant
expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). Individual microRNA gene may give rise to
miRNAs of different length, named isomiRNAs that proved to be functionally
relevant. Since microRNA length heterogeneity in hepatic tissue has not been
described before, we employed next-generation sequencing to comprehensively
analyze microRNA transcriptome in HCC tumors (n=24) and unaffected tissue
adjacent to tumors (n=24), including samples with (n=15) and without cirrhosis
(n=9). We detected 374 microRNAs expressed in liver, including miR-122-5p that
constituted over 39% of the hepatic miRnome. Among the liver expressed miRs, the 
levels of 64 significantly differed between tumor and control samples (FDR<0.05, 
fold change>2). Top deregulated miRNAs included miR-1269a (T/N=22.95),
miR-3144-3p (T/N=5.24), miR-183-5p (T/N=4.63), miR-10b-5p (T/N=3.87), miR-490-3p 
(T/N=0.13), miR-199a-5p (T/N=0.17), miR-199a-3p/miR-199b-3p (T/N=0.19),
miR-214-5p (T/N=0.20) and miR-214-3p (T/N=0.21). Almost all miRNA genes produced 
several mature molecules differing in length (isomiRNAs). The reference sequence 
was not the most prevalent in 38.6% and completely absent in 10.5% of isomiRNAs. 
Over 26.1% of miRNAs produced isoforms carrying≥2 alternative seed regions, of
which 35.5% constituted novel, previously unknown seeds. This fact sheds new
light on the percentage of the human genome regulated by microRNAs and their
variants. Among the most deregulated miRNAs, miR-199a-3p/miR-199b-3p (T/N fold
change=0.18, FDR=0.005) was expressed in 9 isoforms with 3 different seeds,
concertedly leading to upregulation of TGF-beta signaling pathway (OR=1.99;
p=0.004). In conclusion, the study reveals the comprehensive miRNome of hepatic
tissue and provides new tools for investigation of microRNA-dependent pathways in
cirrhotic liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. This article is part of a Directed 
Issue entitled: Rare Cancers.

diseases.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a worldwide health problem and is one of the
main causes of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). However, only limited therapeutic options and no vaccines are currently
available against HCV infection. Recent studies of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are 
able to regulate HCV replication and its related liver diseases by directly
interacting with the HCV genome or indirectly controlling virus-associated host
pathways, have broadened our understanding of the HCV life cycle. HCV utilizes
host cellular miRNAs and modulates expression of miRNAs in infected hepatocytes
for its infection and propagation. Moreover, such miRNAs directly or indirectly
alter HCV replication efficiency and induce liver diseases including liver
fibrosis, cirrhosis, or HCC. Representatively, miR-122 directly modulates the HCV
life cycle by increasing HCV translation and genomic RNA stability. Recently, a
phase IIa clinical trial with miravirsen, an LNA form of antimiR-122
oligonucleotides, showed significant reduction in serum HCV levels in patients
chronically infected with HCV with no detectible evidence of resistance. In
addition to miR-122, other miRNAs involved in the regulation of HCV propagation
could be targeted in strategies to modulate HCV replication and pathogenesis. In 
this review, we summarize the features of miRNAs critical for HCV replication and
HCV-mediated liver abnormalities and briefly discuss their potential application 
as therapeutic reagents for the treatment of HCV infection and its related
diseases.

response to hepatitis C virus infection.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure leads to persistent life-long infections
characterized by chronic inflammation often developing into cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanism by which HCV remains in the liver while
inducing an inflammatory and antiviral response remains unclear. Though the
innate immune response to HCV in patients seems to be quite active, HCV has been 
shown in cell culture to employ a diverse array of innate immune antagonists,
which suggests that current model systems to study interactions between HCV and
the innate immune system are not representative of what happens in vivo. We
recently showed that hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells support the entire HCV life
cycle if the liver-specific microRNA, miR-122, is expressed along with the entry 
factor, CD81 (termed HepG2-HFL cells). We found that there was a striking
difference in these cells' ability to sustain HCV infection and spread when
compared with Huh-7 and Huh-7.5 cells. Additionally, HepG2-HFL cells exhibited a 
more robust antiviral response when challenged with other RNA viruses and viral
mimetics than Huh-7 and Huh-7.5 cells. HCV infection elicited a potent
interferon-lambda (IFN-λ), IFN-stimulated gene, and cytokine response in
HepG2-HFL cells, but not in Huh-7 cells, suggesting that HepG2-HFL cells more
faithfully recapitulate the innate immune response to HCV infection in vivo.
Using this model, we found that blocking the retinoic acid-inducible gene I
(RIG-I)-like receptor pathway or the IFN-λ-signaling pathway promoted HCV
infection and spread in HepG2-HFL cells.CONCLUSION: HepG2-HFL cells represent a
new system to study the interaction between HCV and the innate immune system,
solidifying the importance of IFN-λ in hepatic response to HCV infection and
revealing non-redundant roles of RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated
protein 5 in HCV recognition and repression of infection.

Sorafenib represents the first effective targeted therapy for advanced stage
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, adequate patient stratification
regarding sorafenib-responsiveness is still missing. Our aim was to analyse the
association between the pretreatment microRNA profile of HCC and patient survival
under sorafenib treatment. Total RNA was extracted from diagnostic fine-needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB) cytological smears of 20 advanced stage HCC patients
collected between June 2008 and July 2012. All patients underwent sorafenib
administration after FNA. Clinicopathological and survival data were recorded.
Fourteen frequently deregulated miRNAs in HCC (miR-17-5p, miR-18a, miR-21,
miR-34a, miR-122, miR-195, miR-210, miR-214, miR-221, miR-222, miR-223, miR-224, 
miR-140, miR-328) were tested by qRT-PCR. NormFinder software was used to select 
proper miR (mir-140) as a reference. Satisfactory amount of total RNA was
obtained from all the considered samples (mean 10.8 ± 9.3 µg, range 0.2-32.2 µg).
Among the analysed miRNAs, high miR-214 expression was associated with smaller
tumor size (p=0.019), whereas high miR-17-5p expression correlated with better
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p=0.003). The survival
analysis revealed that high miR-224 expression was associated with increased
progression-free and overall survival (PFS p=0.029; OS p=0.012). Pretreatment
microRNA profiling, especially miR-224 expression, might serve as an ancillary
tool for the better assessment of expected survival rates for patients under
sorafenib treatment.

MicroRNA (miRNA) exert a profound effect on Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication
and on the manifestation of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
miR-122 in particular, is highly enriched in liver and has been shown to interact
with HCV, suggesting this virus has evolved to subvert and manipulate the host
gene silencing machinery in order to support its life cycle. It is therefore
likely that miR-122 and other miRNAs play an important role in the
pathophysiology of HCV infection. The changes in post-transcriptional gene
regulation by the miRNAs may play a key role in the manifestation of chronic
liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding of HCV-host miRNA
interactions will ultimately lead to the design of therapeutic modalities against
HCV infection and HCV-mediated HCC and may also provide important biomarkers that
direct treatment options. Here, we review the current knowledge on the role of
miRNA and gene expression on HCV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma, in
addition to the possible role of miRNA as future therapeutic targets.

The identification of aflatoxins as human carcinogens has stimulated extensive
research efforts, which continue to the present, to assess potential health
hazards resulting from contamination of the human food supply and to minimize
exposure. The use of biomarkers that are mechanistically supported by
toxicological studies will be important tools for identifying stages in the
progression of development of the health effects of environmental agents. miRNAs 
are small non-coding mRNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression.
Also, they are molecular markers of cellular responses to various chemical
agents. Growing evidence has demonstrated that environmental chemicals can induce
changes in miRNA expression. miRNAs are good biomarkers because they are well
defined, chemically uniform, restricted to a manageable number of species, and
stable in cells and in the circulation. miRNAs have been used as serological
markers of HCC and other tumors. The expression patterns of different miRNAs can 
distinguish among HCC-hepatitis viruses related, HCC cirrhosis-derivate, and HCC 
unrelated to either of them. The main objective of this review is to find
unreported miRNAs in HCC related to other causes, so that they can be used as
specific molecular biomarkers in populations exposed to aflatoxins and as early
markers of exposure, damage/presence of HCC. Until today specific miRNAs as
markers for aflatoxins-exposure and their reliability are currently lacking.
Based on their elucidated mechanisms of action, potential miRNAs that could serve
as possible markers of HCC by exposure to aflatoxins are miR-27a, miR-27b,
miR-122, miR-148, miR-155, miR-192, miR-214, miR-221, miR-429, and miR-500.
Future validation for all of these miRNAs will be needed to assess their
prognostic significance and confirm their relationship with the induction of HCC 
due to aflatoxin exposure.

miR-122 is a liver-rich-specific microRNA that plays an important role in hepatic
gene expression via post-transcription regulation, and it is potentially
associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been
confirmed that miR-122 is down-regulated during HBV infection; however, how HBV
affects miR-122 is still debated. One research provided evidence that HBx could
reduce the miR-122 transcription level, but the other insisted that HBV had no
significant effect on miR-122 transcription level but reduce miR-122 level via
binding and sequestering endogenous miR-122. It is determinate that Gld2 could
increase the specific miRNA stabilization by monoadenylation which was a
post-transcription regulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
mechanism of HBV-induced reduction of miR-122 and examine whether Gld2 is
involved in it. According to the results of a microRNA microarray, we found
miR-122 was the most down-regulated microRNA in HepG2.2.15 compared to HepG2. As 
revealed by qRT-PCR and western blotting analyses, both miR-122 and Gld2 levels
were reduced in hepatic cell lines with expression of HBV or HBx but not other
proteins of HBV, and over-expression of Gld2 could abolish the effect of HBV and 
HBx on the miR-122 level. What's more, both HBV and HBx have no significant
effect on pre-miR-122 levels. And the dual-luciferase assay implicated that HBx
could reduce the Gld2 promoter activity but had no significant effect on miR-122 
promoter activity. In conclusion, HBx is a critical protein derived from HBV,
which regulates miR-122 via down-regulating Gld2.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that repress their
targets at post transcriptional level. Existing studies have shown that miRNAs
are important regulatory genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as either tumor
suppressors or oncogenes. MiR-122 is normally downregulated in HCC and regarded
as a tumor suppressor. Recently miR-122 has been reported to be regulated by
CEBPA, which is then involved in a novel pathway to influence proliferation of
tumor cells. However it is unknown whether CEBPA is regulated by miRNAs in HCC.
In this study, we find that miR-182 is upregulated in HCC model rat, and
represses CEBPA in both rat and human. This further improves the current
CEBPA/miR-122 pathway that controls the proliferation of tumor cells. These
results suggest that miR-182 is a potential oncogene in HCC and could be used as 
a diagnostic marker and drug target of HCC.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a highly abundant and liver-specific miRNA, acts as a
tumor suppressor against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Decreased expression of 
miR-122 in HCC is frequently observed and is associated with poor
differentiation, larger tumor size, metastasis and invasion, and poor prognosis. 
Mutant mice with knockout (KO) of the miR-122 locus developed steatohepatitis due
to increased triglyceride (TG) synthesis and decreased TG secretion from
hepatocytes, and eventually developed HCC. Exogenic miR-122 introduction into
miR-122 KO mice inhibited the development of HCC. Target genes of miR-122,
including cyclin G1, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)10, serum response
factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, ADAM17, transcription factor
CUTL1, the embryonic isoform of pyruvate kinase (Pkm2), Wnt1, pituitary
tumor-transforming gene 1 binding factor, Cut-like homeobox 1, and c-myc, are
involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and
angiogenesis. MiR-122 expression is regulated by liver-enriched transcription
factors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1α, HNF3β, HNF4α, HNF6, and
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)α. A positive feedback loop exists between 
C/EBPα and miR-122 and between HNF6 and miR-122, whereas a negative feedback loop
exists between c-myc and miR-122. Since cotreatment of 5-Aza-Cd and histone
deacetylase inhibitor restored miR-122 expression in HCC cells, epigenetic
modulation of miR-122 expression is involved in the suppression of miR-122 in
HCC. Several experiments suggest that increasing miR-122 levels in HCC with or
without antitumor agents may be a promising strategy for HCC treatment.

miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which target complementary mRNA sequences,
usually resulting in gene silencing. They can exhibit oncogenic or tumor
suppressor properties, modulating cell homeostasis. Several data have documented 
that miRNAs are typically deregulated in different types of cancers, including
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some of the miRNAs such as miR-122, miR-221,
miR-1 and miR-21 have been found to repress post-transcriptionally the expression
of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell
migration and invasion. In HCC serum levels of miR-122, miR-221 and miR-16 have
been described deregulated, suggesting that they may be used as molecular targets
for early detection, prognosis and treatment. The ov-serpin SerpinB3 was found
previously increased in liver tumor cancers and associated with apoptosis
resistance, increased cell proliferation and invasiveness. Recent data indicate
that this serpin may enhance its oncogenic potential through inhibition of
several tumor suppressive miRNAs, typically described in HCC.

In contrast to normal differentiated cells that depend on mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation for energy production, cancer cells have evolved to utilize
aerobic glycolysis (Warburg's effect), with benefit of providing intermediates
for biomass production. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is highly expressed in normal
liver tissue regulating a wide variety of biological processes including cellular
metabolism, but is reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of
miR-122 was shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and increase 
chemosensitivity, but its functions in cancer metabolism remains unknown. The
present study aims to identify the miR-122 targeted genes and to investigate the 
associated regulatory mechanisms in HCC metabolism. We found the ectopic
overexpression of miR-122 affected metabolic activities of HCC cells, evidenced
by the reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption. Integrated
gene expression analysis in a cohort of 94 HCC tissues revealed miR-122 level
tightly associated with a battery of glycolytic genes, in which pyruvate kinase
(PK) gene showed the strongest anti-correlation coefficient (Pearson r = -0.6938,
p = <0.0001). In addition, reduced PK level was significantly associated with
poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. We found isoform M2 (PKM2) is the
dominant form highly expressed in HCC and is a direct target of miR-122, as
overexpression of miR-122 reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of PKM2,
whereas PKM2 re-expression abrogated the miR-122-mediated glycolytic activities. 
The present study demonstrated the regulatory role of miR-122 on PKM2 in HCC,
having an implication of therapeutic intervention targeting cancer metabolic
pathways.

A growing list of microRNAs (miRNAs) show aberrant expression patterns in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the regulatory mechanisms largely remain
unclear. RNA editing catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on
the RNA (ADAR) family could target the miRNA precursors and affect the biogenesis
process. Therefore, we investigate whether RNA editing could be one mechanism
contributing to the deregulation of specific miRNAs in HCC. By overexpression of 
individual ADARs in hepatoma cells, RNA editing on the precursors of 16 miRNAs
frequently deregulated in HCC was screened by a sensitive high-resolution melting
platform. The results identified RNA precursors of miR-214 and miR-122 as
potential targets edited by ADAR2. A subset of HCC showing elevated ADAR2
verified the major editings identified in ARAR2 overexpressed hepatoma cells,
either with A-to-I or U-to-C changes. The unusual U-to-C editing at specific
residues was demonstrated as being attributed to the A-to-I editing on the RNA
transcripts complementary to the pri-miRNAs. The editing event caused a decrease 
of the RNA transcript complementary to pri-miR-214, which led to the decrease of 
pri-miR-214 and miR-214 and resulted in the increased protein level of its novel 
target gene Rab15. In conclusion, the current study discovered ADAR2-mediated
editing of the complementary antisense transcripts as a novel mechanism for
regulating the biogenesis of specific miRNAs during hepatocarcinogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: Intratumoral administration of adenoviral vector encoding herpes
simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (TK) gene (Ad-TK) followed by systemic
ganciclovir (GCV) is an effective approach in treating experimental
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, hepatotoxicity due to unwanted vector
spread and suicide gene expression limited the application of this therapy.
miR-122 is an abundant, liver-specific microRNA whose expression is decreased in 
human primary HCC and HCC-derived cell lines. These different expression profiles
provide an opportunity to induce tumor-specific gene expression by miR-122
regulation.
METHODS: By inserting miR-122 target sequences (miR-122T) in the 3' untranslated 
region (UTR) of TK gene, we constructed adenovirus (Ad) vectors expressing
miR-122-regulated TK (Ad-TK-122T) and report genes. After intratumoral
administration of Ad vectors into an orthotopic miR-122-deficient HCC mouse
model, we observed the miR-122-regulated transgene expression and assessed the
antitumor activity and safety of Ad-TK-122T.
RESULTS: Insertion of miR-122T specifically down-regulated transgene expression
in vitro and selectively protected the miR-122-positive cells from killing by
TK/GCV treatment. Insertion of miR-122T led to significant reduction of tansgene 
expression in the liver without inhibition of its expression in tumors in vivo,
resulting in an 11-fold improvement of tumor-specific transgene expression.
Intratumoral injection of Ad vectors mediated TK/GCV system led to a vector
dosage-dependent regression of tumor. The insertion of miR-122T does not
influence the antitumor effects of suicide gene therapy. Whereas mice
administrated with Ad-TK showed severe lethal hepatotoxicity at the effective
therapeutic dose, no liver damage was found in Ad-TK-122T group.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-122-regulated TK expression achieved effective anti-tumor
effects and increased the safety of intratumoral delivery of adenovirus-mediated 
TK/GCV gene therapy for miR-122-deficient HCC.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently pegylated interferon (IFN) combined with
ribavirin remains the best therapeutic approach, although patients infected with 
HCV genotype I may benefit from adding protease inhibitors as 'triple therapy'.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene
expression and have recently been shown to play an important role in human innate
immune response and as an antiviral in chimpanzees. We studied the effect of
miR-130a on the HCV replication. We found that miR-130a significantly inhibits
HCV replication in both HCV replicon and J6-/JFH1-infected cells. Over expression
of miR-130a upregulated the expression of type I IFN (IFN-α/IFN -β), ISG15, USP18
and MxA, which are involved in innate immune response and decreased expression of
miR-122, a well-defined miRNA promoting HCV production. In conclusion, miR-130a
inhibits HCV replication/production by restoring host innate immune responses
and/or downregulating pro-HCV miR-122. miR-130a might be a potential drug target 
by modulating host innate immune responses to combat HCV infection.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to define the correlation between microRNA-122
(miR-122) expression and hepatectomy-induced liver injury in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Plasma miR-122 expression in patients with HCC and healthy age-matched
controls was determined, and correlated with plasma alanine transaminase activity
(ALT) and bilirubin levels preoperatively and on days 1 and 7 postoperation.
Correlations between plasma miR-122 and clinicopathological characteristics at 1 
day postoperation were also determined.
RESULTS: This study included 80 patients with HCC and 80 controls. Baseline
expression of miR-122 mRNA and ALT in patients with HCC was significantly higher 
than in controls. MiR-122 expression correlated with ALT and bilirubin levels
preoperatively and on days 1 and 7 postoperatively. In patients with HCC who
received a block of the first hepatic portal during surgery and those with
excised tumour size >5 cm, plasma miR-122 expression was significantly increased 
on day 1 postoperatively, compared with expression levels in those who did not
receive a block and those with smaller tumours.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma miR-122 expression is correlated with hepatectomy-induced
liver injury in patients with HCC. Increase in miR-122 expression could be used
as an index of such injury before and after hepatectomy in these patients.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the orchestration of diverse cellular 
processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis and are
believed to play pivotal roles as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. miR-122, a
liver specific miRNA, is significantly down-regulated in most hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCCs) but its role in tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Here
we identify AKT3 as a novel and direct target of miR-122. Restoration of miR-122 
expression in HCC cell lines decreases AKT3 levels, inhibits cell migration and
proliferation, and induces apoptosis. These anti-tumor phenotypes can be rescued 
by reconstitution of AKT3 expression indicating the essential role of AKT3 in
miR-122 mediated HCC transformation. In vivo, restoration of miR-122 completely
inhibited xenograft growth of HCC tumor in mice. Our data strongly suggest that
miR-122 is a tumor suppressor that targets AKT3 to regulate tumorigenesis in HCCs
and a potential therapeutic candidate for liver cancer.

Mechanisms of hepatic carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are
incompletely defined but often assumed to be similar and related to
immune-mediated inflammation. Despite this, several studies hint at differences
in expression of miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA with tumor suppressor
properties, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B virus
(HBV) versus hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Differences in the expression of 
miR-122 in these cancers would be of interest, as miR-122 is an essential host
factor for HCV but not HBV replication. To determine whether the abundance of
miR-122 in cancer tissue is influenced by the nature of the underlying virus
infection, we measured miR-122 by qRT-PCR in paired tumor and non-tumor tissues
from cohorts of HBV- and HCV-infected Japanese patients. miR-122 abundance was
significantly reduced from normal in HBV-associated HCC, but not in liver cancer 
associated with HCV infection. This difference was independent of the degree of
differentiation of the liver cancer. Surprisingly, we also found significant
differences in miR-122 expression in non-tumor tissue, with miR-122 abundance
reduced from normal in HCV- but not HBV-infected liver. Similar differences were 
observed in HCV- vs. HBV-infected chimpanzees. Among HCV-infected Japanese
subjects, reductions in miR-122 abundance in non-tumor tissue were associated
with a single nucleotide polymorphism near the IL28B gene that predicts poor
response to interferon-based therapy (TG vs. TT genotype at rs8099917), and
correlated negatively with the abundance of multiple interferon-stimulated gene
transcripts. Reduced levels of miR-122 in chronic hepatitis C thus appear to be
associated with endogenous interferon responses to the virus, while differences
in miR-122 expression in HCV- versus HBV-associated HCC likely reflect
virus-specific mechanisms contributing to carcinogenesis. The continued
expression of miR-122 in HCV-associated HCC may signify an important role for HCV
replication late in the progression to malignancy.

Effects of microRNAs on fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) expression in hepatocarcinoma
cells.

Research, University of Genova, Genova, Italy.

Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) catalyzes the transfer of α1,6-linked fucose to the
first N-acetylglucosamine in N-linked glycans (core fucosylation). Increased core
fucosylation has been reported during hepatocarcinogenesis, in both
cell-associated and secreted proteins. Accordingly, increased core fucosylation
of α-fetoprotein and α1-antitrypsin is currently used as a diagnostic and
prognostic indicator. The present study provides new evidences that FUT8 can be
regulated also through miRNA-mediated mechanisms. Using microRNA/target
prediction programs, we identified miR-122 and miR-34a seed regions in the 3'
untranslated region (3'UTR) of FUT8. Then we used human and rodents
hepatocarcinoma cell lines to evaluate the impact of transfection of miR-122 and 
miR-34a mimics on FUT8 mRNA and protein levels. This study demonstrated that
forced expression of these miRNAs is able to induce a decrease of FUT8 levels and
also to affect core fucosylation of secreted proteins. The ability of miR-122 and
miR-34a to specifically interact with and regulate the 3'UTR of FUT8 was
demonstrated via a luciferase reporter assay. Since miR-122 and miR-34a
downregulation is a common feature in spontaneous human hepatocarcinoma, our
finding that these miRNAs are able to target FUT8 3'UTR suggests that, together
with transcriptional and other post-transcriptional systems, a miRNA-mediated
mechanism could also be involved in the increased core fucosylation observed in
liver tumors. Moreover, these findings also point out that miRNAs may be widely
involved in the regulation of glycosylation machinery.

Reciprocal regulation of microRNA-122 and c-Myc in hepatocellular cancer: role of
E2F1 and transcription factor dimerization partner 2.

c-Myc is a well-known oncogene frequently up-regulated in different malignancies,
whereas liver-specific microRNA (miR)-122, a bona fide tumor suppressor, is
down-regulated in hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Here we explored the underlying
mechanism of reciprocal regulation of these two genes. Real-time
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and northern blot
analysis demonstrated reduced expression of the primary, precursor, and mature
miR-122 in c-MYC-induced HCCs compared to the benign livers, indicating
transcriptional suppression of miR-122 upon MYC overexpression. Indeed, chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed significantly reduced association of RNA 
polymerase II and histone H3K9Ac, markers of active chromatin, with the miR-122
promoter in tumors relative to the c-MYC-uninduced livers, indicating
transcriptional repression of miR-122 in c-MYC-overexpressing tumors. The ChIP
assay also demonstrated a significant increase in c-Myc association with the
miR-122 promoter region that harbors a conserved noncanonical c-Myc binding site 
in tumors compared to the livers. Ectopic expression and knockdown studies showed
that c-Myc indeed suppresses expression of primary and mature miR-122 in hepatic 
cells. Additionally, Hnf-3β, a liver enriched transcription factor that activates
miR-122 gene, was suppressed in c-MYC-induced tumors. Notably, miR-122 also
repressed c-Myc transcription by targeting transcriptional activator E2f1 and
coactivator Tfdp2, as evident from ectopic expression and knockdown studies and
luciferase reporter assays in mouse and human hepatic cells.CONCLUSION: c-Myc
represses miR-122 gene expression by associating with its promoter and by
down-regulating Hnf-3β expression, whereas miR-122 indirectly inhibits c-Myc
transcription by targeting Tfdp2 and E2f1. In essence, these results suggest a
double-negative feedback loop between a tumor suppressor (miR-122) and an
oncogene (c-Myc).

MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene
expression by pairing with partially complementary target sequences in the 3'UTRs
of mRNAs to promote degradation and/or block translation. Aberrant miR expression
is associated with development of multiple diseases including hepatic diseases.
The role of miRs in the regulation of gene expression and rapid progress in the
field of microRNA research are resulting in momentum toward development of
diagnostic markers and novel therapeutic strategies for human liver diseases.
Recent studies provide clear evidence that miRs are abundant in the liver and
modulate a diverse spectrum of biological functions, thereby supporting an
association between alterations of miR homeostasis and pathological liver
diseases. Here we review the role of miRs in liver as their physiological and
pathological importance has been demonstrated in metabolism, immunity, viral
hepatitis, oncogenesis, fatty liver diseases (alcoholic and non-alcoholic),
drug-induced liver injury, fibrosis as well as acute liver failure.

BACKGROUND: The identification of new biomarkers to predict the aggressiveness of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and supplement the current set of prognosis and
treatment algorithms is an important clinical need. Extracellular microRNAs
(miRNAs) circulating in the blood are a new class of highly promising disease
markers.
AIM: Here we investigated the prognostic potential of miR-1 and miR-122 in sera
from patients with HCC.
METHODS: RNA was extracted from 195 sera of HCC patients and 54 patients with
liver cirrhosis, obtained at the time of study enrolment. miR-1 and miR-122
levels were correlated with overall survival (OS), Cancer of the Liver Italian
Program (CLIP) score, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, clinical chemistry
parameters and tumor specific treatment.
RESULTS: Patients with higher miR-1 and miR-122 serum levels showed longer OS
than individuals with lower miR-1 and miR-122 serum concentrations (hazard ratio 
[HR] 0.440, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.233-0.831, P=0.011 for miR-1 and HR
0.493, 95% CI 0.254-0.956, P=0.036 for miR-122, respectively). Serum miR-1 and
miR-122 concentrations did not differ significantly between patients with HCC and
liver cirrhosis. An age-, sex-, tumor stage and treatment-adjusted multivariate
Cox regression analysis revealed that miR-1 serum levels (HR 0.451, 95% CI
0.228-0.856, P=0.015) were independently associated with OS, whereas serum
miR-122 was not. miR-1 serum levels showed no relevant correlation with clinical 
chemistry liver parameters, whereas serum miR-122 correlated with clinical
chemistry parameters of hepatic necroinflammation, liver function and synthetic
capacity.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that serum miR-1 is a new independent parameter of 
OS in HCC patients and may therefore improve the predictive value of classical
HCC staging scores.

MicroRNA miR-122 as a therapeutic target for oligonucleotides and small
molecules.

Thomas M(1), Deiters A.

The most abundant microRNA (miRNA) in the liver, miR-122, is regulated by
specific, liver-enriched transcription factors and is responsible for proper
proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes and for the regulation of lipid 
and cholesterol metabolisms. miR-122 is also involved in several hepatic
disorders, as downregulation of miR-122 is often associated with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and miR-122 is a required component for the replication and
proliferation of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Various probes have been developed 
to promote a better understanding of the involvement of miR-122 in liver
diseases, including modified antisense agents and small molecule inhibitors.
These agents, capable of specifically modifying miR-122 activity, provide
excellent tools to investigate the function and regulation of miR-122 and offer
potential new lead compounds for drug discovery. Especially small molecule
modifiers can display numerous advantages over nucleotide analogs, as discussed
in this review.

murine liver tumor.

miR-122, a liver-specific tumor suppressor microRNA, is frequently down-regulated
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LNP-DP1, a cationic lipid nanoparticle
formulation, was developed as a vehicle to restore deregulated gene expression in
HCC cells by miR-122 delivery. LNP-DP1 consists of
2-dioleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DODMA), egg phosphatidylcholine,
cholesterol and cholesterol-polyethylene glycol. In vitro, LNP-DP1-mediated
transfection of a miR-122 mimic to HCC cells down-regulated miR-122 target genes 
by >95%. In vivo, siRNAs/miRNAs encapsulated in LNP-DP1 were preferentially taken
up by hepatocytes and tumor cells in a mouse HCC model. The miR-122 mimic in
LNP-DP1 was functional in HCC cells without causing systemic toxicity. To
demonstrate its therapeutic potential, LNP-DP1 encapsulating miR-122 mimic was
intratumorally injected and resulted in ~50% growth suppression of HCC xenografts
within 30 days, which correlated well with suppression of target genes and
impairment of angiogenesis. These data demonstrate the potential of
LNP-DP1-mediated microRNA delivery as a novel strategy for HCC therapy.FROM THE
CLINICAL EDITOR: In this study, LNP-DP1 -a cationic lipid nanoparticle
formulation -is reported as a vehicle to restore deregulated gene expression in
hepatic carcinoma cells by siRNA and miRNA delivery using a mouse model. Further 
expansions to this study may enable transition to clinical trials of this system.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), tumor specificity of gene therapy is of utmost
importance to preserve liver function. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful negative
regulators of gene expression and many are downregulated in human HCC. We
identified seven miRNAs that are also downregulated in tumors in a rat hepatoma
model (P<0.05) and attempted to improve tumor specificity by constructing a panel
of luciferase-expressing vectors containing binding sites for these miRNAs.
Attenuation of luciferase expression by the corresponding miRNAs was confirmed
across various cell lines and in mouse liver. We then tested our vectors in
tumor-bearing rats and identified two miRNAs, miR-26a and miR-122, that
significantly decreased expression in liver compared with the control vector
(6.40 and 0.26%, respectively; P<0.05). In tumor, miR-122 had a nonsignificant
trend towards decreased (∼50%) expression, whereas miR-26 had no significant
effect on tumor expression. To our knowledge, this is the first work using
differentially expressed miRNAs to de-target transgene expression in an
orthotopic hepatoma model and to identify miR-26a, in addition to miR-122, for
de-targeting liver. Considering the heterogeneity of miRNA expression in human
HCC, this information will be important in guiding development of more
personalized vectors for the treatment of this devastating disease.

Medicine, New Orleans, LA.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a pivotal liver-specific miRNA, has been implicated in
several liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatitis C
and B viral infection. This study aimed to explore epigenetic regulation of
miR-122 in human HCC cells and to examine the effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
and hepatitis B virus (HBV). We performed microRNA microarray analysis and
identified miR-122 as the most up-regulated miRNA (6-fold) in human HCC cells
treated with 5'aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR, DNA methylation inhibitor) and
4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA, histone deacetylation inhibitor). Real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analysis verified significant up-regulation of miR-122 by
5'aza and PBA in HCC cells, and to a lesser extent in primary hepatocytes.
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) and retinoid X receptor 
alpha (RXRα) complex was found to be associated with the DR1 and DR2 consensus
site in the miR-122 gene promoter which enhanced miR-122 gene transcription.
5-Aza-CdR and PBA treatment increased the association of PPARγ/RXRα, but
decreased the association of its corepressors (N-CoR and SMRT), with the miR-122 
DR1 and DR2 motifs. The aforementioned DNA-protein complex also contains SUV39H1,
an H3K9 histone methyl transferase, which down-regulates miR-122
expression.CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish a novel role of the PPARγ
binding complex for epigenetic regulation of miR-122 in human HCC cells.
Moreover, we show that hepatitis B virus X protein binds PPARγ and inhibits the
transcription of miR-122, whereas hepatitis C viral particles exhibited no
significant effect; these findings provide mechanistic insight into reduction of 
miR-122 in patients with HBV but not with HCV infection.

Small, noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological functions in the 
liver and increasing evidence suggests that they have a role in liver pathology. 
This Review summarizes advances in the field of miRNAs in liver diseases,
inflammation and cirrhosis. MicroRNA-122, the most abundant miRNA in hepatocytes,
has well-defined roles in HCV replication, and data indicate that it also serves 
as a viable therapeutic target. The role of miR-122 is also emerging in other
liver diseases. Ample evidence exists for the important regulatory potential of
other miRNAs in conditions associated with liver inflammation related to alcohol 
use, the metabolic syndrome or autoimmune processes. In addition, a broad array
of miRNAs have been associated with the development of liver fibrosis both in
animal models and human studies. The significance of the function and cellular
distribution of miRNAs in the liver and the potential of miRNAs as a means of
communication between cells and organs is discussed as well as the emerging
utility of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of different forms of liver damage
and as early markers of disease and progression in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Importantly, miRNA modulation in the liver represents a new therapeutic approach 
in the treatment armamentarium of hepatologists in the future.

Targeting miRNAs to treat Hepatitis C Virus infections and liver pathology:
Inhibiting the virus and altering the host.

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection-induced liver disease is a growing problem
worldwide, and is the primary cause of liver failure requiring liver
transplantation in North America. Improved therapeutic strategies are required to
control and possibly eradicate HCV infections, and to modulate HCV-induced liver 
disease. Cellular microRNAs anneal to and regulate mRNA translation and stability
and form a regulatory network that modulates virtually every cellular process.
Thus, miRNAs are promising cellular targets for therapeutic intervention for an
array of diseases including cancer, metabolic diseases, and virus infections. In 
this review we outline the features of miRNA regulation and how miRNAs may be
targeted in strategies to modulate HCV replication and pathogenesis. In
particular, we highlight miR-122, a miRNA that directly modulates the HCV life
cycle using an unusual mechanism. This miRNA is very important since miR-122
antagonists dramatically reduced HCV titres in HCV-infected chimpanzees and
humans and currently represents the most likely candidate to be the first
miRNA-based therapy licensed for use. However, we also discuss other miRNAs that 
directly or indirectly alter HCV replication efficiency, liver cirrhosis,
fibrosis and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We also discuss a
few miRNAs that might be targets to treat HCV in cases of HCV/HIV co-infection.
Finally, we review methods to deliver miRNA antagonists and mimics to the liver. 
In the future, it may be possible to design and deliver specific combinations of 
miRNA antagonists and mimics to cure HCV infection or to limit liver
pathogenesis.

The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)
has a clinical promise for treatment of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). To investigate effect of SAHA on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, we
treated the HCV replicon cell OR6 with SAHA. HCV replication was significantly
inhibited by SAHA at concentrations below 1 μM with no cellular toxicity. Another
HDAC inhibitor, tricostatin A, also showed reduction of HCV replication. The
microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated up-regulation of
osteopontin (OPN) and down-regulation of apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1) after SAHA
treatment. Direct gene induction of OPN and knockdown of Apo-A1 also showed
reduction of HCV replication. The liver specific microRNA-122, which is involved 
in HCV replication, was not affected by SAHA treatment. These results suggest
that SAHA has suppressive effect on HCV replication through alterations of gene
expression such as OPN and Apo-A1 in host cells. Epigenetic treatment with HDAC
inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic approach for diseases associated with HCV
infection such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and HCC.

As the most abundant liver-specific microRNA, miR-122 is involved in diverse
aspects of hepatic function and neoplastic transformation. Our previous study
showed that miR-122 levels are significantly decreased in hepatitis B virus
(HBV)-infected patients, which may facilitate viral replication and persistence
(S. Wang, L. Qiu, X. Yan, W. Jin, Y. Wang, L. Chen, E. Wu, X. Ye, G. F. Gao, F.
Wang, Y. Chen, Z. Duan, and S. Meng, Hepatology 55:730-741, 2012). Loss of
miR-122 expression in patients with hepatitis B enhances hepatitis B virus
replication through cyclin G1-modulated P53 activity.). In this study, we provide
evidence that all HBV mRNAs harboring an miR-122 complementary site act as
sponges to bind and sequester endogenous miR-122, indicating that the highly
redundant HBV transcripts are involved in HBV-mediated miR-122 suppression. We
next identified pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) binding factor (PBF) 
as a target of miR-122 and demonstrated that HBV replication causes an obvious
increase in PBF levels. Furthermore, we observed that the miR-122 levels were
decreased and PBF was upregulated in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression and knockdown studies both revealed that PBF
enhances proliferation and invasion of HCC cells, and silencing PBF resulted in a
dramatic reduction of HCC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated
that PBF interacts with PTTG1 and facilitates PTTG1 nuclear translocation,
subsequently increasing its transcriptional activities. Therefore, we identified 
a novel HBV mRNA-miR-122-PBF regulatory pathway that facilitates malignant
hepatocyte growth and invasion in CHB which may contribute to CHB-induced HCC
development and progression. Our work underscores the reciprocal interplay of
host miRNA sequestration and depletion by viral mRNAs, which may contribute to
chronic-infection-related cancer.

miRNAs are emerging as critical regulators in carcinogenesis and tumor
progression. Recently, microRNA-122 (miR-122) has been proved to play an
important role in hepatocellular carcinoma, but its functions in the context of
breast cancer (BC) remain unknown. In this study, we report that miR-122 is
commonly downregulated in BC specimens and BC cell lines with important
functional consequences. Overexpression of miR-122 not only dramatically
suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation by inducing G1-phase cell-cycle
arrest in vitro, but also reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. We then screened and
identified a novel miR-122 target, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R),
and it was further confirmed by luciferase assay. Overexpression of miR-122 would
specifically and markedly reduce its expression. Similar to the restoring miR-122
expression, IGF1R downregulation suppressed cell growth and cell-cycle
progression, whereas IGF1R overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of
miR-122. To identify the mechanisms, we investigated the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway 
and found that the expression of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K were suppressed, whereas
re-expression of IGF1R which did not contain the 3'UTR totally reversed the
inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signal pathway profile. We also identified a novel,
putative miR-122 target gene, PI3CG, a member of PI3K family, which further
suggests miR-122 may be a key regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In clinical
specimens, IGF1R was widely overexpressed and its mRNA levels were inversely
correlated with miR-122 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 
miR-122 functions as a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in inhibiting
the tumorigenesis through targeting IGF1R and regulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K
pathway. Given these, miR-122 may serve as a novel therapeutic or
diagnostic/prognostic-target for treating BC.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), which accounts for 70% of the liver's total miRNAs, plays
a pivotal role in the liver. However, its intrinsic physiological roles remain
largely undetermined. We demonstrated that mice lacking the gene encoding
miR-122a (Mir122a) are viable but develop temporally controlled steatohepatitis, 
fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These mice exhibited a striking
disparity in HCC incidence based on sex, with a male-to-female ratio of 3.9:1,
which recapitulates the disease incidence in humans. Impaired expression of
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) contributed to steatosis, which
was reversed by in vivo restoration of Mttp expression. We found that hepatic
fibrosis onset can be partially attributed to the action of a miR-122a target,
the Klf6 transcript. In addition, Mir122a(-/-) livers exhibited disruptions in a 
range of pathways, many of which closely resemble the disruptions found in human 
HCC. Importantly, the reexpression of miR-122a reduced disease manifestation and 
tumor incidence in Mir122a(-/-) mice. This study demonstrates that mice with a
targeted deletion of the Mir122a gene possess several key phenotypes of human
liver diseases, which provides a rationale for the development of a unique
therapy for the treatment of chronic liver disease and HCC.

miR-122, an abundant liver-specific microRNA (miRNA), regulates cholesterol
metabolism and promotes hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Reduced miR-122
expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlates with metastasis and poor 
prognosis. Nevertheless, the consequences of sustained loss of function of
miR-122 in vivo have not been determined. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of
mouse Mir122 resulted in hepatosteatosis, hepatitis, and the development of
tumors resembling HCC. These pathologic manifestations were associated with
hyperactivity of oncogenic pathways and hepatic infiltration of inflammatory
cells that produce pro-tumorigenic cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF. Moreover,
delivery of miR-122 to a MYC-driven mouse model of HCC strongly inhibited
tumorigenesis, further supporting the tumor suppressor activity of this miRNA.
These findings reveal critical functions for miR-122 in the maintenance of liver 
homeostasis and have important therapeutic implications, including the potential 
utility of miR-122 delivery for selected patients with HCC and the need for
careful monitoring of patients receiving miR-122 inhibition therapy for HCV.

The details of molecular alterations occurring during hepatocarcinogenesis have
not been revealed yet. Nevertheless, it is known that microRNAs (miRNA), these
short RNA molecules regulating gene expression mainly in a negative way, are also
involved in this process. Altered miRNA expression levels are present in liver
diseases when compared with normal liver tissue, and the observed alterations
depend mainly on which is more advantegous for the disease: activation or
inhibition of the genes (e.g. oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes) regulated by
the altered miRNAs. The miRNA expression pattern described in hepatocellular
carcinoma seems to differ the most from that found in the normal liver; however, 
remarkable alterations at miRNA levels have been published in early stages of
hepatic tumor progression such as fibrosis and chronic hepatitis. For example,
the expression of miR-21, miR-221, miR-222 and miR-199a showing characteristic
alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma also displayed deregulated expressions in
these two early stages. The liver characteristic miRNA, miR-122, usually exhibits
a decreased expression level upon liver injury as well as miR-122 expression
tends to decrease as hepatic carcinogenesis progresses. Besides, miR-122 enhances
the replication of hepatitis C virus and the initial low or high level of miR-122
seems to influence the efficiency of interferon therapy. Recently, statistically 
significant differences have been detected in the expression of several miRNAs
being present in the serum of patients with chronic hepatitis, chirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with normal controls. It suggests that
serum miRNAs could be potential biomarkers. In this article, the major and recent
alterations of microRNA expression patterns in stages of hepatocarcinogenesis
such as fibrosis, viral infections (hepatitis), cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma are summarized.

The most common etiologic agents causing chronic hepatitis are hepatitis C and B 
viruses (HCV and HBV, respectively). Chronic infection caused by HCV is
considered one of the major causative agents of liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. In combination with the increasing rate of
new HCV infections, the lack of a current vaccine and/or an effective treatment
for this virus continues to be a major public health challenge. The development
of new treatments requires a better understanding of the virus and its
interaction with the different components of the host cell. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
are small non-coding RNAs functioning as negative regulators of gene expression
and represent an interesting lead to study HCV infection and to identify new
therapeutic targets. Until now, microRNA-122 (miR-122) and its implication in HCV
infection have been the focus of different published studies and reviews. Here we
will review recent advances in the relationship between HCV infection and miRNAs,
showing that some of them emerge in publications as challengers against the
supremacy of miR-122.

As the most abundant liver-specific microRNA, microRNA-122 (miR-122) is involved 
in various physiological processes in hepatic function as well as in liver
pathology. There is now compelling evidence that miR-122, as a regulator of gene 
networks and pathways in hepatocytes, plays a central role in diverse aspects of 
hepatic function and in the progress of liver diseases. This liver-enriched
transcription factors-regulated miRNA promotes differentiation of hepatocytes and
regulates lipid metabolism. With regard to liver diseases, miR-122 was shown to
stimulate hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication through a unique and unusual
interaction with two binding sites in the 5'-UTR of HCV genome to mediate the
stability of the viral RNA, whereas inhibit the expression and replication of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) by a miR-122-cylin G1/p53-HBV enhancer regulatory
pathway. In addition, miR-122 acts as a suppressor of cell proliferation and
malignant transformation of hepatocytes with remarkable tumor inhibition
activity. Notably, a clinical trial targeting miR-122 with the anti-miR-122
oligonucleotides miravirsen, the first miRNA targeted drug, has been initiated
for treatment of HCV infection. With further understanding of the comprehensive
roles of miR-122 in hepatic functions and the mechanisms involved in miR-122
down-regulation in chronic hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma, miR-122 appears
to be a promising candidate for effective therapeutic approaches against tumor
and infectious diseases.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most common etiologic agents of chronic
liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In
addition, HCV infection is often associated with extrahepatic manifestations
(EHM), including mixed cryoglobulinemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the 
mechanisms of cell tropism of HCV and HCV-induced EHM remain elusive, because in 
vitro propagation of HCV has been limited in the combination of cell
culture-adapted HCV (HCVcc) and several hepatic cell lines. Recently, a
liver-specific microRNA called miR-122 was shown to facilitate the efficient
propagation of HCVcc in several hepatic cell lines. In this study, we evaluated
the importance of miR-122 on the replication of HCV in nonhepatic cells. Among
the nonhepatic cell lines expressing functional HCV entry receptors, Hec1B cells 
derived from human uterus exhibited a low level of replication of the HCV genome 
upon infection with HCVcc. Exogenous expression of miR-122 in several cells
facilitates efficient viral replication but not production of infectious
particles, probably due to the lack of hepatocytic lipid metabolism. Furthermore,
expression of mutant miR-122 carrying a substitution in a seed domain was
required for efficient replication of mutant HCVcc carrying complementary
substitutions in miR-122-binding sites, suggesting that specific interaction
between miR-122 and HCV RNA is essential for the enhancement of viral
replication. In conclusion, although miR-122 facilitates efficient viral
replication in nonhepatic cells, factors other than miR-122, which are most
likely specific to hepatocytes, are required for HCV assembly.

High-throughput luciferase reporter assay for small-molecule inhibitors of
microRNA function.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs of 21 to 23
nucleotides that regulate gene expression, typically by binding the 3'
untranslated regions of target messenger RNAs. It is estimated that miRNAs are
involved in the regulation of 30% of all genes and almost every genetic pathway. 
Recently, the misregulation of miRNAs has been linked to various human diseases
including cancer and viral infections, identifying miRNAs as potential targets
for drug discovery. Thus, small-molecule modifiers of miRNAs could serve as lead 
structures for the development of new therapeutic agents and be useful tools in
the elucidation of detailed mechanisms of miRNA function. As a result, we have
developed a high-throughput screen for potential small-molecule regulators of the
liver-specific microRNA miR-122, which is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma
development and hepatitis C virus infection. Our small-molecule screen employs a 
Huh7 human hepatoma cell line stably transfected with a Renilla luciferase sensor
for endogenous miR-122. The assay was optimized and validated using an miR-122
antisense agent and a previously identified small-molecule miR-122 inhibitor. The
described reporter assay will enable the high-throughput screening of
small-molecule miR-122 inhibitors and can be readily extended to other miRNAs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as endogenous
silencers of numerous target genes. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in
the human genome. miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and play
important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Aberrant
expression of miRNAs may also contribute to the development and progression of
human hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers. Recent studies have shown that some
miRNAs play roles as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in hepatobiliary and
pancreatic cancers. miR-122, let-7 family, and miR-101 are down-regulated in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that it is a potential tumor
suppressor of HCC. miR-221 and miR-222 are up-regulated in HCC and may act as
oncogenic miRNAs in hepatocarcinogenesis. miRNA expression profiling may be a
powerful clinical tool for diagnosis and regulation of miRNA expression could be 
a novel therapeutic strategy for hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers. In this
review, we summarize current knowledge about the roles of important tumor
suppressor microRNAs and oncogenic microRNAs in hepatobiliary and pancreatic
cancers.

AIMS: To validate whether the anti-cancer effect of microRNA-122 (miR-122) on
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mediated through regulating Wnt/β-catenin
signalling pathways.
METHODS: The expression levels of miR-122 in HCC tissues and varied hepatoma
cells were quantified by real-time PCR. MiR-122 agomir was transfected into
HepG2, Hep3B cells to over-express miR-122. The effect of over-expression miR-122
on proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 and Hep3B cells was evaluated using CCK-8
kit and flow cytometer respectively. The 3'-UTR segments of Wnt1 containing the
miR-122 binding sites were amplified by PCR and the luciferase activity in the
transfected cells was assayed. Wnt1 mRNA level was quantified using RT-PCR.
Protein levels of Wnt1, β-catenin and TCF-4 were detected using Western blotting.
RESULTS: In comparison with the expression level of miR-122 in para-cancerous
tissues or Chang liver cell, the expression level in HCC tissues or varied
hepatoma cells was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Over-expression of miR-122
significantly inhibited the proliferation (P < 0.05), and promoted the apoptosis 
of HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Over-expressed miR-122 down-regulated the protein
levels of Wnt1, β-catenin and TCF-4 (P < 0.05). MiR-122 suppressed the luciferase
activity of the pmiR-Wnt1-wt by approximately 50% compared with the negative
control, while mutation or removal of the miR-122 binding site using siRNA or
mir-122 inhibitor blocked the suppressive effect (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-122 expression is down-regulated in human HCC. Over-expression
of miR-122 inhibits HCC cell growth and promotes the cell apoptosis by affecting 
Wnt/β-catenin-TCF signalling pathway.

microRNA-122 (miR-122) was one of the first examples of a tissue-specific miRNA. 
It is highly expressed in liver, where it constitutes 70% of the total miRNA
pool. miR-122 expression is specific to the vertebrate lineage, where the
sequence of the mature miRNA is completely conserved. miR-122 is a target for
extensive study due to its association with cholesterol metabolism and
hepatocellular carcinoma, and its important role in promoting hepatitis C virus
(HCV) replication. This review will discuss the biogenesis and function of
miR-122.

MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding molecules found to regulate a variety of
cellular functions in health and disease. Dysregulation of microRNAs is involved 
in liver disease, especially hepatocarcinogenesis. Since primary hepatic
malignancies are typically characterized by late diagnosis, frequent recurrence, 
and poor response to adjuvant therapy, there is a need for the discovery of novel
biomarkers in order to achieve earlier diagnosis, predict tumor aggressiveness
and response to adjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
expression of certain microRNAs (miR-21, -31, -122, -145, -146a, - 200c, -221,
-222 and -223) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), as well as to assess their prognostic significance.
Micro-RNA expression was assessed by reverse transcription and real-time PCR
(RT-PCR). Clinicopathological data and survival rates were retrieved and
analyzed. According to our results, miR-21, miR-31, miR-122, miR-221, miR-222
were significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues, whereas miR-145, miR-146a,
miR-200c, and miR-223 were found to be down-regulated. Concerning ICC samples,
miR-21, miR-31, and miR-223 were found to be over-expressed, whereas miR-122,
miR-145, miR-200c, miR-221, and miR-222 were down-regulated. Additionally,
expression of miR-21, miR-31, miR-122, and miR-221 in HCC correlated with
cirrhosis, while miR-21 and miR-221 associated with tumor stage and poor
prognosis. In ICC tissues, miR-21, miR-31, and miR-223 were found to be
over-expressed, but no correlation with clinicopathological features was found.

Differential stimulation of hepatitis C virus RNA translation by microRNA-122 in 
different cell cycle phases.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicates preferentially in the liver, and in most cases
the HCV infection becomes chronic and often results in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
When the HCV plus-strand RNA genome has been delivered to the cytosol of the
infected cell, its translation is directed by the Internal Ribosome Entry Site
(IRES) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the viral RNA. Thereby, IRES
activity is modulated by several host factors. In particular, the liver-specific 
microRNA-122 (miR-122) interacts with two target sites in the HCV 5'-UTR and
stimulates HCV translation, thereby most likely contributing to HCV liver
tropism. Here we show that HCV IRES-dependent translation efficiency in the
hepatoma cell line Huh7 is highest during the G₀ and G₁ phases of the cell cycle 
but significantly drops during the S phase and even more in the G₂/M phase. The
superimposed stimulation of HCV translation by ectopic miR-122 works best during 
the G₀, G₁ and G₂/M phases but is lower during the S phase. However, the levels
of Ago2 protein do not substantially change during cell cycle phases, indicating 
that other cellular factors involved in HCV translation stimulation by miR-122
may be differentially expressed in different cell cycle phases. Moreover, the
levels of endogenously expressed miR-122 in Huh7 cells are lowest in the S phase,
indicating that the predominant G₀/G₁ state of non-dividing hepatocytes in the
liver facilitates high expression of the HCV genome and stimulation by miR-122,
with yet unknown factors involved in the differential extent of stimulation by
miR-122.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to anticipate great cancer
diagnostic potential. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been reported as
promising biomarkers for various pathologic conditions. The objective of this
study was to investigate the potential of serum miRNAs as novel biomarkers for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

candidate serum miRNAs were detected by using real-time RT-PCR, corresponding 10 
HCC patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 10 age- and
sex-matched healthy subjects. (II) Marker validation by real-time RT-PCR on HBV
patients with (n = 48) or without HCC (n = 48), and healthy subjects (n = 24).
(III) Marker detection by real-time RT-PCR in sera from another 14 HCC patients
before and 1 month after surgical resection. (IV) We examined the correlation
between the expressions of candidate serum miRNAs with clinical parameters of HCC
patients. Although miR-222, miR-223 or miR-21 were significantly up- or
down-regulated between HCC patients and healthy controls, no significant
difference was observed in the levels of these miRNAs between HBV patients
without and with HCC. MiR-122 in serum was significantly higher in HCC patients
than healthy controls (p<0.001). More importantly, it was found that the levels
of miR-122 were significantly reduced in the post-operative serum samples when
compared to the pre-operative samples. Although serum miR-122 was also elevated
in HBV patients with HCC comparing with those without HCC, the difference was at 
the border line (p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that serum miR-122 might serve as a
novel and potential noninvasive biomarker for detection of HCC in healthy
subjects, moreover, it might serve as a novel biomarker for liver injury but not 
specifically for detection of HCC in chronic HBV infection patients.

Selective replication in tumor cells is a highly desirable feature for oncolytic 
viruses. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles
in controlling gene expression, and that certain tissue-specific miRNAs are
frequently downregulated in malignant cells. miR-122 is a liver-specific
microRNA. It is abundantly expressed in normal hepatocytes but is absent in many 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We hypothesized that expression of an
essential viral gene by a liver-specific promoter would initially restrict virus 
replication to cells of hepatic origin and that adding miR-122 complementary
sequences to the viral gene would make the transcripts degradable by miR-122 in
normal hepatocytes, thus further confining its replication to HCC. We have
constructed such an oncolytic herpes simplex virus by linking the essential viral
glycoprotein H gene with the liver-specific apolipoprotein E (apoE)-AAT promoter 
and by adding the miR-122a complimentary sequence to the 3' untranslated region
(3'UTR). To further increase the safety of this virus, complementary sequences
from miR-124a and let-7 were also engineered into the same 3'UTR. Designated
liver-cancer specific oncolytic virus (LCSOV), it was highly selective in killing
HCC cells and in shrinking HCC xenografts. We conclude that LCSOV is a highly
specific oncolytic virus that can precisely target HCC.

PURPOSE: More than 60% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) do not
receive curative therapy as a result of late clinical presentation and diagnosis.
We aimed to identify plasma microRNAs for diagnosing hepatitis B virus (HBV)
-related HCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma microRNA expression was investigated with three
independent cohorts including 934 participants (healthy, chronic hepatitis B,
cirrhosis, and HBV-related HCC), recruited between August 2008 and June 2010.
First, we used microarray to screen 723 microRNAs in 137 plasma samples for
diagnosing HCC. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
assay was then applied to evaluate the expression of selected microRNAs. A
logistic regression model was constructed using a training cohort (n = 407) and
then validated using an independent cohort (n = 390). Area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: We identified a microRNA panel (miR-122, miR-192, miR-21, miR-223,
miR-26a, miR-27a and miR-801) that provided a high diagnostic accuracy of HCC
(AUC = 0.864 and 0.888 for training and validation data set, respectively). The
satisfactory diagnostic performance of the microRNA panel persisted regardless of
disease status (AUCs for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stages 0, A, B, and C were
0.888, 0.888, 0.901, and 0.881, respectively). The microRNA panel can also
differentiate HCC from healthy (AUC = 0.941), chronic hepatitis B (AUC = 0.842), 
and cirrhosis (AUC = 0.884), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We found a plasma microRNA panel that has considerable clinical value
in diagnosing early-stage HCC. Thus, patients who would have otherwise missed the
curative treatment window can benefit from optimal therapy.

Mechanisms involved in the development of chronic hepatitis C as potential
targets of antiviral therapy.

At present, about 3% of the human population are infected with hepatitis C virus 
(HCV). The first, acute stage of the disease is usually asymptomatic. However,
only 15-25% of the infected eliminate the virus, while the remaining patients
develop chronic hepatitis C (CHC). After 10-30 years of CHC, cirrhosis occurs in 
20-30% of patients; 5-10% of this group eventually suffer from hepatocellular
carcinoma. Unfortunately, up till now no effective methods protecting against HCV
or allowing for efficient CHC treatment have been elaborated. This is primarily
because not much is known about the mechanism of CHC emergence and the factors
affecting anti-HCV therapy. There are several lines of evidence that some
specific features of the virus, especially its high genetic variability might be 
responsible for the maintenance of HCV infection. Moreover, a few mechanisms
which affect host-virus interactions and can additionally support CHC development
have recently been identified. Hybridization between the host-encoded,
liver-specific microRNA (miR-122) and the 5'-untranslated region of HCV genome
was shown to be required for effective viral RNA replication. It was also
postulated that HCV proteins mimic some of the human ones; that is why the virus 
is not eliminated. Another hypothesis assumes that interactions between HCV E2
glycoprotein and CD81 receptor modulate various cellular pathways, thus
supporting viral propagation. There is no doubt that a better understanding of
the mechanisms described above is of great importance for designing new
therapeutic strategies and anti-HCV drugs.

fatty liver disease.

MicroRNAs miR-122, miR-34a, miR-16 and miR-21 are commonly deregulated in liver
fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study examined whether circulating
levels of these miRNAs correlate with hepatic histological disease severity in
patients with chronic hepatitis C infection (CHC) or non-alcoholic fatty-liver
disease (NAFLD) and can potentially serve as circulating markers for disease
stage assessment. We first used an in vitro model of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection to measure the extracellular levels of these four miRNAs. Whereas
miR-21 extracellular levels were unchanged, extracellular levels of miR-122,
miR-34a and to a lesser extent miR-16, steadily increased during the course of
HCV infection, independently of viral replication and production. Similarly, in
CHC patients, serum levels of miR-122, miR-34a and miR-16 were significantly
higher than in control individuals, while miR-21 levels were unchanged. There was
no correlation between the serum levels of any of these microRNAs and HCV viral
loads. In contrast, miR-122 and miR-34a levels positively correlated with disease
severity. Identical results were obtained in an independent cohort of CHC
patients. We extended the study to patients with NAFLD. As observed in CHC
patients, serum levels of miR-122, miR-34a and miR-16 were significantly higher
in NAFLD patients than in controls, while miR-21 levels were unchanged. Again,
miR-122 and miR-34a levels positively correlated with disease severity from
simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. In both CHC and NAFLD patient groups, serum 
levels of miR-122 and miR-34a correlated with liver enzymes levels, fibrosis
stage and inflammation activity. miR-122 levels also correlated with serum lipids
in NAFLD patients.CONCLUSION: Serum levels of miR-34a and miR-122 may represent
novel, noninvasive biomarkers of diagnosis and histological disease severity in
patients with CHC or NAFLD.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular cancer characterized by rapid
progression as well as resistance to conventional chemotherapy. It has been shown
that microRNAs play critical roles in pathogenesis of HCC. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122)
is a liver-specific microRNA and is frequently downregulated in HCC. In the
present study, we investigated whether restoration of miR-122 in HCC cells could 
render cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents adriamycin (ADM) or vincristine
(VCR). Our data showed that overexpression of miR-122 in HCC cells induced by
adenovirus expressing miR-122 could render cell sensitive to ADM or VCR. Analysis
of cell cycle distribution showed that the anti-proliferative effect of miR-122
is associated with increase of cell number in the G2/M phase. Moreover, treatment
with Ad-miR122 and ADM or VCR resulted in high accumulation of HCC cells in G2/M 
phase. We further demonstrated that overexpression of miR-122 could modulate the 
sensitivity of the HCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through downregulating MDR
related genes MDR-1, GST-π, and MRP, antiapoptotic gene Bcl-w and cell cycle
related gene cyclin B1. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that
combination of Ad-miR122 with chemotherapeutic agents inhibited HCC cell growth
by inducing G2/M arrest and that this arrest is associated, at least in part,
with reduced expression of MDR related genes and Cyclin B1.

The loss of microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression correlates to many characteristic
properties of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, including clonogenic
survival, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasion,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and tumorigenesis. However, all of these
findings do not sufficiently explain the oncogenic potential of miR-122. In the
current study, we used two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis to
measure changes in the expression of thousands of proteins in response to the
inhibition of miR-122 in human hepatoma cells. Several proteins that were
upregulated on miR-122 inhibition were involved in the unfolded protein response 
(UPR) pathway. The overexpression of miR-122 resulted in the repression of UPR
pathway activation. Therefore, miR-122 may act as an inhibitor of the chaperone
gene expression and negatively regulate the UPR pathway in HCC. We further showed
that the miR-122 inhibitor enhanced the stability of the 26S proteasome
non-ATPase regulatory subunit 10 (PSMD10) through the up-regulation of its target
gene cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). This process may activate the UPR pathway 
to prevent chemotherapy-mediated tumor cell apoptosis. The current study suggests
that miR-122 negatively regulates the UPR through the CDK4-PSMD10 pathway. The
down-regulation of miR-122 activated the CDK4-PSMD10-UPR pathway to decrease
tumor cell anticancer drug-mediated apoptosis. We identified a new HCC
therapeutic target and proclaimed the potential risk of the therapeutic use of
miR-122 silencing.

microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs with post-transcriptional
regulatory functions that participate in diverse biological pathways. miR-122, a 
liver-specific miRNA, has been found to be down-regulated in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and HCC-derived cell lines. In this study, miR-122 was
down-regulated in the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC cell line HepG2.2.15
compared to HepG2. NDRG3, a member of the N-myc downstream-regulated gene (NDRG) 
family, was up-regulated in HepG2.2.15 and was identified as a target gene of
miR-122. An inverse correlation between the expression of miR-122 and the NDRG3
protein was noted in HBV-related HCC specimens. The transfection of the miR-122
expression vector into the HepG2.2.15 cell line repressed the transcription and
expression of NDRG3, which subsequently reversed the malignant phenotype of the
cells. The replication of HBV, expression of viral antigens and proliferation of 
cells were significantly inhibited by restoration of miR-122. The data
demonstrate that miR-122 plays an important role in HBV-related
hepatocarcinogenesis by targeting NDRG3. Thus, miR-122 and NDRG3 represent key
diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for HBV-related HCC.

Gankyrin is a small ankyrin-repeat protein that previous research has confirmed
to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although relevant
literature has reported on gankyrin functions in cellular proliferation and
tumorigenesis, the exact role of gankyrin is poorly understood in animal model
systems. This study analyzed hepatic lipid accumulation in gankyrin transgenic
(GK) zebrafish. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells were predominantly
increased in the liver bud of GK larvae, indicating that gankyrin functionally
promoted cell proliferation at the larval stage in GK fish. However, over 90% of 
the viable GK adults showed an increased lipid content, leading in turn to liver 
steatosis. Liver histology and oil red O staining also indicated the accumulation
of fatty droplets in GK fish, consistent with the specific pathological features 
of severe steatosis. Molecular analysis revealed that gankyrin overexpression
induced hepatic steatosis and modulated the expression profiles of four hepatic
microRNAs, miR-16, miR-27b, miR-122, and miR-126, and 22 genes involved in lipid 
metabolism. Moreover, significantly increased hepatic cell apoptosis resulted in 
liver damage in GK adults, leading to liver failure and death after approximately
10months. This study is the first to report gankyrin as a potential link between 
microRNAs and liver steatosis in zebrafish.

Role of microRNAs in hepatitis B virus replication and pathogenesis.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a widespread human pathogen and chronic HBV
infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of 
microRNA (miRNA) in the replication and pathogenesis was reviewed. So far none of
HBV-encoded miRNA has been identified. Cellular miRNAs have shown able to
regulate HBV at the transcription level either by targeting to cellular
transcriptions factors required for HBV gene expression, or by a directly binding
to HBV transcripts. We also summarized the changed patterns of cellular miRNAs
from hepatitis B progressing to cirrhosis and then liver cancer. The changing of 
a few of miRNAs, such as miR-122 or miR-21, were reproduced and worthy of further
research by a deep sequencing and functional validation. These HBV-specific
miRNAs should potentially become biomarkers for HBV infection and HBV-positive
HCC diagnosis. The understanding of miRNA biology paved the way for applying
miRNAs-based RNAi against HBV replication with minimal toxicities. This article
is part of a Special Issue entitled: MicroRNAs in viral gene regulation.

The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human tumorigenesis has been demonstrated by
gene profiling and functional studies. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
consistently deregulated miRNAs were identified. Their aberrant expression
revealed relations shared with other types of cancer and others unique to HCC,
namely the down-regulation of miR-122. Most importantly, functional and molecular
studies uncovered mechanisms that linked deregulated miRNAs to cancer-associated 
pathways, thereby placing their deregulation in a more rational framework. These 
results improved our knowledge concerning the molecular basis of HCC and helped
to increase our understanding about the great clinical potential behind these
small molecules. In fact, a number of studies proved that miRNAs may have
clinical relevance as bio-pathologic markers for HCC classification, prognostic
stratification, early diagnosis or follow-up of patients. Additionally, the
demonstration that miRNAs themselves or anti-miRNA oligonucleotides could be
successfully used for in vivo modulation of miRNA actions has shown significant
potentials in molecularly targeted therapy. In this context, the liver represents
an organ of election to test therapeutic possibilities associated with miRNAs.

MicroRNAs function as important regulators of gene expression and are commonly
linked to development, differentiation, and diseases such as cancer. To better
understand their roles in various biological processes, identification of genes
targeted by microRNAs is necessary. Although prediction tools have significantly 
helped with this task, experimental approaches are ultimately required for
extensive target search and validation. We employed two independent yet
complementary high throughput approaches to map a large set of mRNAs regulated by
miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA implicated in regulation of fatty acid and
cholesterol metabolism, hepatitis C infection, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The 
combination of luciferase reporter-based screening and shotgun proteomics
resulted in the identification of 260 proteins significantly down-regulated in
response to miR-122 in at least one method, 113 of which contain predicted
miR-122 target sites. These proteins are enriched for functions associated with
the cell cycle, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Among these
miR-122-sensitive proteins, we identified a large group with strong connections
to liver metabolism, diseases, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional analyses,
including examination of consensus binding motifs for both miR-122 and target
sequences, provide further insight into miR-122 function.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious public health hazard. Polygenes
involvement, accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes and immune response
of viral vector during gene therapy have resulted in the high mortality rate
without marked change. To provide a safeguard for gene therapy and the
feasibility for a clinical application, efforts have been focused predominantly
upon constructing liver-targeted vector recently. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of 
short endogenous RNAs, regulate the gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level through imperfect base pairing with the 3'-untranslated region of target
mRNAs. miRNAs, especially the liver-specific miRNA: miR-122, have multiple
functions in liver development and abnormal expression of miRNAs could lead to
liver diseases. Altered miRNA expressions have been observed in HCCs, viral
hepatitis and hepatic ﬁbrosis. The different expression profiles of miRNAs in HCC
suggest that miRNAs may serve as either novel potential targets acting directly
as oncogenes or therapeutic molecules working as tumor suppressor genes.
Moreover, the abundance in general and liver specificity in particular, all
together make them attractive to be considered as elements for hepatic specific
targeting viral vector. This review describes recent progress in miRNA
investigation on liver associated for better understanding the relationship
between miRNA and liver cancer in order to raise prospects for therapy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in crucial biological processes, and it is now
evident that miRNA alterations are involved in the progression of human cancers. 
Recent studies on miRNA profiling performed with cloning suggest that sequencing 
is useful for the detection of novel miRNAs, modifications, and precise
compositions and that miRNA expression levels calculated by clone count are
reproducible. Here we focus on sequencing of miRNA to obtain a comprehensive
profile and characterization of these transcriptomes as they relate to human
liver. Sequencing using 454 sequencing and conventional cloning from 22 pair of
HCC and adjacent normal liver (ANL) and 3 HCC cell lines identified reliable
reads of more than 314000 miRNAs from HCC and more than 268000 from ANL for
registered human miRNAs. Computational bioinformatics identified 7 novel miRNAs
with high conservation, 15 novel opposite miRNAs, and 3 novel antisense miRNAs.
Moreover sequencing can detect miRNA modifications including adenosine-to-inosine
editing in miR-376 families. Expression profiling using clone count analysis was 
used to identify miRNAs that are expressed aberrantly in liver cancer including
miR-122, miR-21, and miR-34a. Furthermore, sequencing-based miRNA clustering, but
not individual miRNA, detects high risk patients who have high potentials for
early tumor recurrence after liver surgery (P = 0.006), and which is the only
significant variable among pathological and clinical and variables (P = 0,022).
We believe that the combination of sequencing and bioinformatics will accelerate 
the discovery of novel miRNAs and biomarkers involved in human liver cancer.

Numerous studies have shown that aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression is
associated with the development and progression of various types of human cancer 
and serum miRNAs are potential biomarkers. This study examined whether some
commonly deregulated miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are presented in
serum of patients with HCC and can serve as diagnostic markers. Serum miRNAs
(miR-21, miR-122, and miR-223) were quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR
in 101 patients with HCC and 89 healthy controls. In addition, 48 patients with
chronic type B hepatitis were also analyzed for comparison. We found that the
median levels of miR-21, miR-122, and miR-223 were significantly higher in
patients with HCC than those in healthy controls (P = 7.48 x 10⁻¹³,
P = 6.93 x 10⁻⁹, and P = 3.90 x 10⁻¹², respectively). However, these elevated
serum miRNAs were also detected in patients with chronic hepatitis
(P = 2.05 x 10⁻¹², P = 4.52 x 10⁻¹⁶, and P = 1.65 x 10⁻¹¹, respectively).
Moreover, serum miR-21 and miR-122 in patients with chronic hepatitis were higher
than in patients with HCC (P = 3.99 x  10⁻⁴ and P = 4.97 x 10⁻⁸), although no
such significant difference was found for miR-223. Receiver-operator
characteristic (ROC) curve analyses suggest that these serum miRNAs may be useful
markers for discriminating patients with HCC or chronic hepatitis from healthy
controls, but not patients with HCC from patients with chronic hepatitis. Our
results indicate that serum miR-21, miR-122 and miR-223 are elevated in patients 
with HCC or chronic hepatitis and these miRNAs have strong potential to serve as 
novel biomarkers for liver injury but not specifically for HCC.

miRNAs (microRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression. In higher
eukaryotes, the tightly controlled expression of different miRNAs, each of which 
regulates multiple target mRNAs, is crucial for the maintenance of tissue type
and the control of differentiation. miR-122 is a highly liver-specific miRNA that
is important in hepatitis C virus infection, cholesterol metabolism and
hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present review, we discuss the effects of
miR-122 on liver physiology and pathology. Recent evidence of pathways involved
in the regulation of miR-122 expression is also considered.

miR-122 is a highly abundant, hepatocyte-specific microRNA. The biomedical
significance and regulatory mechanisms of miR-122 remain obscure. We explored the
role of miR-122 in tumorigenesis in the context of gene regulatory network. The
miR-122 promoter and its transactivator were identified by way of luciferase
reporter system, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays. The miR-122 regulatory circuitry and its implication 
in hepatocarcinogenesis were identified using livers of different development
stages, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines, and
aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁)-transformed cells. We characterized the -5.3 to -4.8 kb
region upstream of miR-122 precursor as miR-122 promoter. Further investigation
revealed that deletion of predicted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα)
binding sites C/EBPα knockdown significantly reduced miR-122 promoter activity
and endogenous miR-122 expression; and C/EBPα directly interacted with the
miR-122 promoter in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that C/EBPα is a
transactivator for miR-122 transcription. We further demonstrated that miR-122
suppressed insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) translation and
sustained glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) activity. The activated GSK-3β
not only repressed cell proliferation, but also activated C/EBPα, which
maintained miR-122 levels and thereby enforced IGF-1R suppression. Interestingly,
down-regulation of miR-122 and C/EBPα, and up-regulation of IGF-1R were
frequently observed in HCC tissues, and decreased miR-122 levels were associated 
with worse survival of HCC patients. Moreover, AFB₁ exposure resulted in
decreased activity in GSK-3β, C/EBPα, and miR-122 and increased levels of IGF-1R,
whereas restoration of miR-122 suppressed the tumorigenicity of HCC and
AFB₁-transformed cells.CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel
GSK-3β-C/EBPα-miR-122-IGF-1R regulatory circuitry whose dysfunction may
contribute to the development of HCC. Our findings provide new insight into
miR-122's function and the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis.

In the past few years there has been growing interest for a type of short RNAs
called microRNAs, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression mainly 
in a negative way. There are about 1000 known microRNA today. It has been
demonstrated that expression level of microRNA may become altered from normal to 
diseased state, thus microRNAs could be employed as a reliable tool in the
diagnosis of diseases. A liver-characteristic microRNA (miR-122) needed for
functioning hepatocytes has been identified, which usually shows a decreased
expression level upon liver injury. miR-122 has been suggested as a biomarker
since it was downregulated in the liver tissue upon acetaminophen-induced
toxicity and in turn elevated miR-122 level was detected in the plasma. Moreover,
miR-122 level in the plasma was found to be more sensitive as compared with
conventional assays based on the release of liver enzymes. Also, miR-122
expression tends to decrease as carcinogenesis progresses. In addition, miR-122
enhances the replication of hepatitis C virus and its level seems to influence
the efficiency of interferon therapy. Nowadays, many microRNAs are known whose
distinctive alterations in their specific patterns seem to characterize
individual pathological processes. In this article, the major alterations in
microRNA expression patterns in liver diseases such as drug- and alcohol-induced 
liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, fibrosis, viral infections
(hepatitis), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are summarized.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is a liver-specific microRNA whose expression is
specifically turned on in the mouse liver during embryogenesis, thus it is
expected to be involved in liver development. However, the role of miR-122 in
liver development and its potential underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we
show that the expression of miR-122 is closely correlated with four
liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs)-hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1α, 
HNF3β, HNF4α, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α-in the livers of
developing mouse embryos and in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. 
Correspondingly, promoter analysis revealed that these LETFs are coordinately
involved in the transcriptional regulation of miR-122, and three HNFs directly
bind to the miR-122 promoter as transcriptional activators. Using a luciferase
reporter system, we identified a group of miR-122 targets involved in
proliferation and differentiation regulation. Among these targets, the most
prominently repressed target was CUTL1, a transcriptional repressor of genes
specifying terminal differentiation in multiple cell lineages, including
hepatocytes. We show that CUTL1 expression is gradually silenced at the
posttranscriptional level during mouse liver development. Overexpression and
knockdown studies both showed that miR-122 repressed CUTL1 protein expression in 
HCC cell lines. Finally, we show that the stable restoration of miR-122 in HepG2 
cells suppresses cellular proliferation and activates the expression of three
hepatocyte functional genes, including the cholesterol-7α hydroxylase gene
(CYP7A1), a known target of CUTL1 in hepatocytes.CONCLUSION: Our study provides a
model in which miR-122 functions as an effector of LETFs and contributes to liver
development by regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation
of hepatocytes, at least by targeting CUTL1.

Tumorigenesis involves multistep genetic alterations. To elucidate the microRNA
(miRNA)-gene interaction network in carcinogenesis, we examined their genome-wide
expression profiles in 96 pairs of tumor/non-tumor tissues from hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Comprehensive analysis of the coordinate expression of miRNAs
and mRNAs reveals that miR-122 is under-expressed in HCC and that increased
expression of miR-122 seed-matched genes leads to a loss of mitochondrial
metabolic function. Furthermore, the miR-122 secondary targets, which decrease in
expression, are good prognostic markers for HCC. Transcriptome profiling data
from additional 180 HCC and 40 liver cirrhotic patients in the same cohort were
used to confirm the anti-correlation of miR-122 primary and secondary target gene
sets. The HCC findings can be recapitulated in mouse liver by silencing miR-122
with antagomir treatment followed by gene-expression microarray analysis. In
vitro miR-122 data further provided a direct link between induction of
miR-122-controlled genes and impairment of mitochondrial metabolism. In
conclusion, miR-122 regulates mitochondrial metabolism and its loss may be
detrimental to sustaining critical liver function and contribute to morbidity and
mortality of liver cancer patients.

MicroRNAs are a recently discovered new class of important endogenous regulators 
of gene function. Aberrant regulation of microRNAs has been linked to various
human diseases, most importantly cancer. Small molecule intervention of microRNA 
misregulation has the potential to provide new therapeutic approaches to such
diseases. Here, we report the first small molecule inhibitors and activators of
the liver-specific microRNA miR-122. This microRNA is the most abundant microRNA 
in the liver and is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma development and
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our small molecule inhibitors reduce viral
replication in liver cells and represent a new approach to the treatment of HCV
infections. Moreover, small molecule activation of miR-122 in liver cancer cells 
selectively induced apoptosis through caspase activation, thus having
implications in cancer chemotherapy. In addition to providing a new approach for 
the development of therapeutics, small molecule modifiers of miR-122 function are
unique tools for exploring miR-122 biogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: Our previous work indicated that overexpression of imprinting gene
PEG10 is associated with malignant phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim
of this study is to explore whether disregulation of PEG10 leads to dysregulation
of microRNAs.
METHODS: In silico analysis using TargetScan indicated that miR-122 could
regulate the expression of PEG10. The expression of miR-122 in three hepatoma
cell lines, Huh7, Hep3B and HepG2 and in primary human normal liver cell were
compared using real time RT-PCR. After pre-miR-122 was transfected into HepG2
cell, the levels of PEG10 mRNA and protein were measured.
RESULTS: In silico analysis revealed that miR-122 could regulate the expression
of PEG10. Real time RT-PCR indicated that miR-122 was not expressed in Hep3B and 
HepG2 cells, and only weakly expressed in Huh7 cells, but highly expressed in
primary human normal liver cells. The expression of miR-122 was negatively
correlated with the expression of PEG10. After pre-miR122 was transfected into
HepG2, the mRNA level of PEG10 was not increased, whereas the protein level of
PEG10 was increased.
CONCLUSION: miR-122 may be involved in regulation of PEG10 expression.

cycle arrest of cancer cells.

BACKGROUND: microRNA-122 (miR-122) plays an important role in both of hepatic
physiology and pathology. Downregulation of miR-122 was reported in human primary
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and restoration of miR-122 could suppress the
growth of cancer cells. In this study, we presented a novel strategy for cancer
therapy based on gene transfer of miR-122 by adenoviral vector.
METHODS: We generated a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing miR-122
(Ad-miR122). The miR-122 expression was measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR
(qRT-PCR). Cell survival rate was determined by MTT assay.
RESULTS: Our data showed that Ad-miR122 could express functional miR-122 in tumor
cells at a high level. Infection of tumor cells with Ad-miR122 resulted in
inhibition of growth of cancer cells originating from liver (HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7
and PLC/PRF/5), lung (NCI-H460) and uterine cervix (HeLa). This antitumor
activity was related to the induction of apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest in
cancer cells. Infection with Ad-miR122 resulted in decreased expression of Bcl-W 
and CCNG1 in cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: The antitumor activity of Ad-miR122 was probably due to the induction
of apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest in cancer cells through inhibiting Bcl-W
and/or CCNG1 expression. We concluded that expression of therapeutic microRNA,
such as miR-122, via adenoviral vector is a promising strategy for cancer
treatment.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy caused by
environmental and genetic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short
non-coding RNAs with posttranscriptional regulatory functions. They participate
in diverse biological pathways and function as gene regulators. Genetic
polymorphisms in 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) targeted by miRNAs alter the
strength of miRNA binding, with consequences on regulation of target genes
thereby affecting the individual's cancer risk. We have previously predicted
polymorphisms falling in miRNA-binding regions of cancer genes. We selected an
insertion/deletion (Indel) polymorphism (rs3783553) in the 3' UTR of interleukin 
(IL)-1alpha (IL1A) for a case-control study in a Chinese population. With samples
from 403 HCC patients and 434 healthy control individuals, strong evidence of
association was observed for the variant homozygote. This association was
validated in a second independent case-control study with 1074 HCC patients and
1239 healthy control individuals (odds ratio = 0.62; 95% confidence interval =
0.49-0.78). We further show that the 'TTCA' insertion allele for rs3783553
disrupts a binding site for miR-122 and miR-378, thereby increasing transcription
of IL-1alpha in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that functional
polymorphism rs3783553 in IL1A could contribute to HCC susceptibility.
Considering IL-1alpha affects not only various phases of the malignant process,
such as carcinogenesis, tumor growth and invasiveness, but also patterns of
interactions between malignant cells and the host's immune system, our results
indicated that IL-1alpha may be a promising target for immunotherapy, early
diagnosis and intervention of HCC.

OBJECTIVE. miR-122 is highly abundant in liver and a hepato-specific microRNA.
There is evidence to show that miR-122 expression is down-regulated in human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is not known whether miR-122 affects the
cellular behavior of hepatoma cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the
effects of miR-122 on the viability and apoptosis of hepatoma cells. MATERIAL AND
METHODS. The viability and apoptosis of Huh-7 and HepG2 cells treated with
miR-122 or miR-122 antisense RNA (anti-miR-122) were analyzed by adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-based luminescent assay, annexin V-based flow cytometry, and
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) detection.
The miR-122 coding genes in both cell lines were sequenced. RESULTS. Although two
putative promoter sequences for the miR-122 gene at 18q21.31 were detected, the
miR-122 coding sequence was missing in HepG2 cells, which might be the reason for
the absence of miR-122 expression. There was no significant difference between
the viabilities of HepG2 cells transfected with miR-122 and mock HepG2 cells (p
>0.05). However, the viability of Huh-7 transfected with anti-miR-122 was
significantly elevated at 24, 36, and 48 h posttransfection compared with that of
mock cells (p <0.01). Both the flow cytometry and TUNEL assay showed that the
apoptotic level of Huh-7 transfected with anti-miR-122 was significantly
decreased at 48 h posttransfection (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS. miR-122 down-regulated
the viability but up-regulated the apoptosis of hepatoma cell Huh-7. The absence 
of miR-122 expression in HepG2 cells was due to the loss of the miR-122 coding
sequence in chromosome 18. These results imply that aberrant expression of
miR-122 may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis.

MicroRNAs are negative regulators of protein coding genes. The liver-specific
microRNA-122 (miR-122) is frequently suppressed in primary hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCCs). In situ hybridization demonstrated that miR-122 is abundantly 
expressed in hepatocytes but barely detectable in primary human HCCs. Ectopic
expression of miR-122 in nonexpressing HepG2, Hep3B, and SK-Hep-1 cells reversed 
their tumorigenic properties such as growth, replication potential, clonogenic
survival, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasion, and tumor formation 
in nude mice. Further, miR-122-expressing HCC cells retained an epithelial
phenotype that correlated with reduced Vimentin expression. ADAM10 (a
distintegrin and metalloprotease family 10), serum response factor (SRF), and
insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1R) that promote tumorigenesis were
validated as targets of miR-122 and were repressed by the microRNA. Conversely,
depletion of the endogenous miR-122 in Huh-7 cells facilitated their tumorigenic 
properties with concomitant up-regulation of these targets. Expression of SRF or 
Igf1R partially reversed tumor suppressor function of miR-122. Further, miR-122
impeded angiogenic properties of endothelial cells in vitro. Notably, ADAM10,
SRF, and Igf1R were up-regulated in primary human HCCs compared with the matching
liver tissue. Co-labeling studies demonstrated exclusive localization of miR-122 
in the benign livers, whereas SRF predominantly expressed in HCC. More
importantly, growth and clonogenic survival of miR-122-expressing HCC cells were 
significantly reduced upon treatment with sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor
clinically effective against HCC. Collectively, these results suggest that the
loss of multifunctional miR-122 contributes to the malignant phenotype of HCC
cells, and miR-122 mimetic alone or in combination with anticancer drugs can be a
promising therapeutic regimen against liver cancer.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are conserved, small (20-25 nucleotide) noncoding RNAs that
negatively regulate expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) at the
posttranscriptional level. Aberrant expression of certain microRNAs plays a
causal role in tumorigenesis. Here, we report identification of hepatic microRNAs
that are dysregulated at early stages of feeding C57BL/6 mice choline-deficient
and amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet that is known to promote nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis after 84 weeks. Microarray
analysis identified 30 hepatic microRNAs that are significantly (P < or = 0.01)
altered in mice fed CDAA diet for 6, 18, 32, and 65 weeks compared with those fed
choline-sufficient and amino acid-defined (CSAA) diet. Real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated
up-regulation of oncogenic miR-155, miR-221/222, and miR-21 and down-regulation
of the most abundant liver-specific miR-122 at early stages of
hepatocarcinogenesis. Western blot analysis showed reduced expression of hepatic 
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta
(C/EBPbeta), respective targets of miR-21 and miR-155, in these mice at early
stages. DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) that
transactivates miR-155 gene was significantly (P = 0.002) elevated in the liver
nuclear extract of mice fed CDAA diet. Furthermore, the expression of miR-155, as
measured by in situ hybridization and real-time RT-PCR, correlated with
diet-induced histopathological changes in the liver. Ectopic expression of
miR-155 promoted growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, whereas its
depletion inhibited cell growth. Notably, miR-155 was significantly (P = 0.0004) 
up-regulated in primary human HCCs with a concomitant decrease (P = 0.02) in
C/EBPbeta level compared with matching liver tissues.CONCLUSION: Temporal changes
in microRNA profile occur at early stages of CDAA diet-induced
hepatocarcinogenesis. Reciprocal regulation of specific oncomirs and their tumor 
suppressor targets implicate their role in NASH-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and 
suggest their use in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of liver cancer.

Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs have a significant role in tumor
development and may constitute robust biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and functional relevance of
microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We
report that miR-122 is specifically repressed in a subset of primary tumors that 
are characterized by poor prognosis. We further show that the loss of miR-122
expression in tumor cells segregates with specific gene expression profiles
linked to cancer progression, namely the suppression of hepatic phenotype and the
acquisition of invasive properties. We identify liver-enriched transcription
factors as central regulatory molecules in the gene networks associated with loss
of miR-122, and provide evidence suggesting that miR-122 is under the
transcriptional control of HNF1A, HNF3A and HNF3B. We further show that loss of
miR-122 results in an increase of cell migration and invasion and that
restoration of miR-122 reverses this phenotype. In conclusion, miR-122 is a
marker of hepatocyte-specific differentiation and an important determinant in the
control of cell migration and invasion. From a clinical point of view, our study 
emphasizes miR-122 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC progression.

The identification of target genes is a key step for assessing the role of
aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNA) in human cancer and for the further
development of miRNA-based gene therapy. MiR-122 is a liver-specific miRNA
accounting for 70% of the total miRNA population. Its down-regulation is a common
feature of both human and mouse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have
previously shown that miR-122 can regulate the expression of cyclin G1, whose
high levels have been reported in several human cancers. We evaluated the role of
miR-122 and cyclin G1 expression in hepatocarcinogenesis and in response to
treatment with doxorubicin and their relevance on survival and time to recurrence
(TTR) of HCC patients. We proved that, by modulating cyclin G1, miR-122
influences p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity and reduces
invasion capability of HCC-derived cell lines. In addition, in a therapeutic
perspective, we assayed the effects of a restored miR-122 expression in
triggering doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and we proved that miR-122, as well as
cyclin G1 silencing, increases sensitivity to doxorubicin challenge. In patients 
resected for HCC, lower miR-122 levels were associated with a shorter TTR,
whereas higher cyclin G1 expression was related to a lower survival, suggesting
that miR-122 might represent an effective molecular target for HCC. Our findings 
establish a basis toward the development of combined chemo- and miRNA-based
therapy for HCC treatment.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are inhibitors of gene expression, participate in
diverse biological functions and in carcinogenesis. In this study, we show that
liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) is significantly down-regulated in liver
cancers with intrahepatic metastasis and negatively regulates tumorigenesis.
Restoration of miR-122 in metastatic Mahlavu and SK-HEP-1 cells significantly
reduced in vitro migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth as well as
in vivo tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and intrahepatic metastasis in an orthotopic
liver cancer model. Because an inverse expression pattern is often present
between an miRNA and its target genes, we used a computational approach and
identified multiple miR-122 candidate target genes from two independent
expression microarray datasets. Thirty-two target genes were empirically
verified, and this group of genes was enriched with genes regulating cell
movement, cell morphology, cell-cell signaling, and transcription. We further
showed that one of the miR-122 targets, ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease
17) is involved in metastasis. Silencing of ADAM17 resulted in a dramatic
reduction of in vitro migration, invasion, in vivo tumorigenesis, angiogenesis,
and local invasion in the livers of nude mice, which is similar to that which
occurs with the restoration of miR-122.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
miR-122, a tumor suppressor microRNA affecting hepatocellular carcinoma
intrahepatic metastasis by angiogenesis suppression, exerts some of its action
via regulation of ADAM17. Restoration of miR-122 has a far-reaching effect on the
cell. Using the concomitant down-regulation of its targets, including ADAM17, a
rational therapeutic strategy based on miR-122 may prove to be beneficial for
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

cell lines.

miR-122, a hepato-specific microRNA (miRNA), is frequently down-regulated in
human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In an effort to identify novel miR-122
targets, we performed an in silico analysis and detected a putative binding site 
in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Bcl-w, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
member. In the HCC-derived cell lines, Hep3B and HepG2, we confirmed that miR-122
modulates Bcl-w expression by directly targeting binding site within the 3'-UTR. 
The cellular mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-w were repressed by elevated levels
of miR-122, which subsequently led to reduction of cell viability and activation 
of caspase-3. Thus, Bcl-w is a direct target of miR-122 that functions as an
endogenous apoptosis regulator in these HCC-derived cell lines.

MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through translational repression or RNA degradation. Many 
fundamental biological processes are modulated by microRNAs, and an important
role for microRNAs in carcinogenesis is emerging. Because understanding the
pathogenesis of viral-associated hepatocellular carcinomas is important in
developing effective means of classification, prognosis, and therapy, we examined
the microRNA expression profiles in a large set of 52 human primary liver tumors 
consisting of premalignant dysplastic liver nodules and hepatocellular carcinomas
by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. All patients were infected
with hepatitis C, and most had liver cirrhosis. Initially, the accessibility of
microRNAs from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival liver tissue by
real-time polymerase chain reaction assays was shown. Subsequently, target
parenchyma from routinely processed tissue was macrodissected, RNA was extracted,
and reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction was performed. Relative quantification was performed by the
2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method with normal livers as a calibrator. In order to obtain a 
comprehensive microRNA gene expression profile, 80 microRNAs were examined in a
subset of tumors, which yielded 10 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated microRNAs
compared to normal liver. Subsequently, five microRNAs (miR-122, miR-100,
miR-10a, miR-198, and miR-145) were selected on the basis of the initial results 
and further examined in an extended tumor sample set of 43 hepatocellular
carcinomas and 9 dysplastic nodules. miR-122, miR-100, and miR-10a were
overexpressed whereas miR-198 and miR-145 were up to 5-fold down-regulated in
hepatic tumors compared to normal liver parenchyma.CONCLUSION: A subset of
microRNAs are aberrantly expressed in primary liver tumors, serving both as
putative tumor suppressors and as oncogenic regulators.

MiR-122 is one of the non-coding RNAs which showed its effects on the
lipo-metablism, virus infection and HCC forming through regulation of liver gene 
expression. Its eukaryotic expression vector was constructed by using pSuper
which was widely applied in the siRNA expression. The precursor of human miR-122 
gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the human genomic DNA.
The positive clones were screened by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. The
new expression vector of miR-122 was named pHsa-m122. PHsa-m122 and its controls 
were transfected to HepG2 cells. The miR-122 expression activity was evaluated by
GFP122i sensor reporter plasmid through fluorescence detection and Western blot. 
It was shown that the fluorescence intensity of GFP122si and pHsa-m122
co-transfection group was weaker than that of the controls, so the functional
activity of expressed miR-122 was detected. When HepG2 cells were co-transfected 
with HBV1.3 and pHsa-m122 plasmids, the results showed miR-122 may down-regulate 
the gene expression of HBV. The human liver specific microRNA eukaryotic
expression vector of miR-122 was constructed successfully, which may facilitate
further study of its function in the development of liver virus infection
diseases and HCC.

In metazoans, most microRNAs imperfectly base-pair with the 3' untranslated
region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs and prevent protein accumulation by either
repressing translation or inducing mRNA degradation. Examples of specific mRNAs
undergoing microRNA-mediated repression are numerous, but whether the repression 
is a reversible process remains largely unknown. Here we show that cationic amino
acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) mRNA and reporters bearing its 3'UTR can be relieved
from the microRNA miR-122-induced inhibition in human hepatocarcinoma cells
subjected to different stress conditions. The derepression of CAT-1 mRNA is
accompanied by its release from cytoplasmic processing bodies and its recruitment
to polysomes. The derepression requires binding of HuR, an AU-rich-element
binding protein, to the 3'UTR of CAT-1 mRNA. We propose that proteins interacting
with the 3'UTR will generally act as modifiers altering the potential of miRNAs
to repress gene expression.
